    "courseDescr": "What's `culture'? There is no such thing as `British culture' as a coherent singular phenomenon, but `culture' can be a useful lens to think about a place, its entanglement with the past and the rest of the world. In this class we can understand how the ideas and social relations that constitute the common-sense fiction of British culture and the very notions of `Britishness', `Englishness', etc. came about historically and are sustained in contemporary contexts. As well as learn how to use `culture' as a heuristic-critical tool to make sense of a particular place's entanglement in history, politics, and cultural production.",

    "courseDescr": "The Roman Empire not only united the Mediterranean basin and much of Europe politically but also precipitated an unprecedented (and hardly since repeated) process of linguistic, cultural, and economic integration and convergence within this region. This process has often been discussed by modern scholars of antiquity under the heading of 'Romanization.' In recent decades, simple models of the displacement of indigenous traditions by 'Roman' cultural norms have been thoroughly critiqued and nuanced, but debate remains regarding the extent and intensiveness of cultural homogenization and integration within the empire as well as the mechanisms by which this occurred. Ultimately, we must interrogate the very nature of this process (e.g., as assimilative or syncretic, coercive or collaborative) as well as what it meant to the inhabitants of the empire to be Roman as well as what Roman-ness (Romanitas) means to us in the modern world. To this end, the course will explore a number of discrete but interrelated topics including linguistic transformations, diffusion of religious traditions, popular culture, the spread of urbanism, Roman citizenship, the adoption of Roman law, human migration and mobility, political and economic integration, as well as ethnic and political identities within the Roman Empire from the 1st century BCE to the 5th Century CE.",

We will approach roles with heightened language and circumstances from scripts that move beyond contemporary realism. We will learn how to build a complex character, with a focus on style, relationship, costume, atmosphere, subtext, sensory inspiration, and inner life. We will explore how a performing artist researches, and how that research can be used to enrich and deepen performance. We will practice how to act truthfully and vividly in a variety of theatrical styles. Students will practice techniques developed by Sanford Meisner, Jerzy Grotowski, Rudolph Laban, Stella Adler, and Michael Chekhov, among others, and will explore performance styles including commedia dell'arte, restoration comedy, and ballroom vogue.

A newer notion of adaptation has emerged in the context of climate change where adaptation takes on a highly instrumental, and often planned, quality as a response to the negative impacts of environmental change. We will discuss each of these ideas, using their commonalities and subtle differences to develop a broader understanding of the dynamic interplay between people and their environments. Topics covered will include, among others: evolution, natural selection, levels of selection, formal models of cultural evolution, replicator dynamics, resilience, rationality and its limits, complexity, adaptive management.",

Due to COVID, all patient and family interaction will be virtual. Students will work with an inter-disciplinary team, conduct virtual calls on patients in their panel, and write progress notes, which will become a part of the patients' electronic medical records. (c) Weekly assignments will help students reflect on their interactions with the patients and lessons they learned. (d) All students will complete a mentored capstone project (either individually or in small groups as they choose) and present this project at the end of the quarter. Our goal is to train future leaders in healthcare and especially in the space of aging and end-of-life care. PLEASE NOTE: This Introductory Seminar is a Cardinal Course. Students who enroll in MED 51Q will be working virtually with patients. As a prerequisite for patient-care, all students (a) must complete HIPAA training, patient safety training, and a background check. All tests required will be provided free of cost and have to be completed with specific agencies affiliated with Stanford. Failure to complete paperwork will result in student being dropped from the class. Dr. Periyakoil will send more specific directions after students are enrolled in MED 51Q.",

At its best, AI can help humans mitigate climate change, diagnose and treat diseases more effectively, enhance learning, and improve access to capital throughout the world. But it also has the potential to exacerbate human biases, destroy trust in information flow, displace entire industries, and amplify inequality throughout the world. We have arrived at a pivotal moment in the development of the technology in which we must establish a foundation for how we will design AI to capture the positive potential and mitigate the negative risks. To do this, we must be intentional about human-centered design because, 'Only once we have thought hard about what sort of future we want, will we be able to begin steering a course toward a desirable future. If we don't know what we want, we're unlikely to get it.' Thus, building AI must be an inclusive, interactive, and introspective process guided by an affirmative vision of a beneficial AI-future. The goal of this interdisciplinary class is to bridge the gap between technological and societal objectives: How do we design AI to promote human well-being? The ultimate aim is to provide tools and frameworks to build a more harmonious human society based on cooperation toward a shared vision. Thus, students are trained in basic science to understand what brings about the conditions for human flourishing and will create meaningful AI technologies that aligns with the PACE framework:·has a clear and meaningful purpose -augments human dignity and autonomy -creates a feeling of inclusivity and collaboration -creates shared prosperity and a sense of forward movement (excellence)Toward this end, students work in interdisciplinary teams on a final project and propose a solution that tackles a significant societal challenge by leveraging technology and frameworks on human thriving.",

    "courseDescr": "Although easy to lose sight of in the midst of the Coronvirus epidemic, the United States is in the midst of an opioid addiction epidemic. More than 10 million Americans 12 years and older are estimated to have misused opioids in 2018, most of which misuse was linked to prescription drugs. Approximately 47,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in that year. Opioid use is reported to have peaked in 2011 but opioid addiction remains a problem in many parts of the country (CNN Editorial Research, \"Opioid Crisis Fast Facts,\" June 21, 2020, available at https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/18/health/opioid-crisis-fast-facts/index.html). The opioid crisis presents a variety of public policy challenges. Like the Crack epidemic of the 1980s, opioid misuse has had disproportionate effects on certain communities. While the former disproportionately affected poor Black urban communities and other urban communities of color, the latter has primarily affected poor White communities, particularly in non-coastal areas of the country. The former was met with popular criticism of its victims and draconian criminal justice policies that incarcerated a generation of Black Americans and other people of color. The latter has been met with an outpouring of concerned media commentary, and funding (however insufficient) for public treatment programs. It is difficult not to conclude that systemic engrained racism explains much of this difference. The opioid crisis also differs from the crack crisis, however, in that opioid victims and their advocates have been able to target responsible parties and attempt to hold them accountable for the harm and losses their conduct has imposed on addicts, their families and their communities. It is widely agreed that the origin of the epidemic was the virtually unlimited distribution of prescription opioid drugs, allegedly encouraged by the drug manufacturers and enabled by other corporations in the pharmaceutical supply chain and by the physicians who prescribed the drugs. The opioid epidemic has also led to a wide-ranging litigation, which has taken as its role model earlier litigation against tobacco manufacturers and ongoing litigation against gun manufacturers. The opioid litigation stands as an example of joining private and public civil litigation to claim compensation for losses due to alleged wrongdoing by private corporations and in the process reshape public policy with regard to harm. To prevail against defendants, plaintiffs have had to persuade courts to apply liability doctrine in unusual although not entirely new ways. Much of the litigation resulting from opioid overdoses and addiction has been contested in the federal courts, which have deployed an armamentarium of formal and informal procedural rules and practices developed over the past several decades to manage and resolve large-scale litigation. Innovative approaches have been adopted by the federal judge assigned to manage the litigation. Key defendants have chosen to manage their liability by seeking the protection of the bankruptcy courts. In sum, the opioid litigation offers opportunities to consider the roles of socio-economic inequality and racial attitudes in shaping perceptions of harm, the potential of tort law to provide remedies for losses, and the challenge of pursuing remedies for mass loss in federal courts. Through readings, guest lectures, discussion and individual research papers on relevant topics of your choice, this seminar will provide both practical information about litigating mass tort claims and space to consider the appropriate role of courts in solving social policy problems.

To ensure proper application and interpretation of linear regression, whether Bayesian or classical, the course develops Bayesian linear regression in depth, omitting no steps. In addition to assessing underlying data, the Bayesian linear conjugate system developed enables analytical answers that are straightforward, perceptive, blazingly quick, simple to implement, and produce results. They are an archetype for more intricate Bayesian systems, presaging what to anticipate. We pay attention to \"big data\" and \"small data,\" the latter more characteristic of real world Decision Analysis. Serial data gathering is illustrated, and classical is shown to be a special case of Bayes. All course examples are solved using R or Excel; there is little emphasis on simulation.

Students will build hand-skills in non-adhesive binding structures drawing from Non-Adhesive Binding1, Art of the Fold2, and Book Forms3. Students will attain a working understanding of paper grain, folding, piercing, tearing, and cutting to produce structures from simple pamphlets to multi-signature thread-sewn softcovers. Bookbinding without glues or pastes will verse students in the mechanics of binding structures and give them the skills to accessibly make zines without expensive or heavy tools. We will spend some class period's outside of the classroom distributing our publications to the student body by passing them out, staging them throughout campus, and tabling. Through the act of distribution and sharing, Students will learn to see the essence of this practice not only in making, but also in giving.

Integration is discussed for rational functions (a loose end from Math 20) and especially (improper) integrals for unbounded functions and \"to infinity\": this shows up in contexts as diverse as escape velocity for a rocket, the present value of a perpetual yield asset, and important calculations in probability (including the famous \"bell curve\" and to understand why many statistical tests work as they do). The course then turns to infinite series (how to \"sum\" an infinite collection of numbers), some useful convergence and divergence rests for these, and the associated killer app: power series and their properties, as well as Taylor approximations, all of which provide the framework that underlies virtually all mathematical models used in any quantitative field.",

If you think of a recent night in which you experienced worse sleep, you might be able to identify something from your awake world that contributed. Much of our awake world is informed by emotion, thoughts, and perception. One could argue that emotion, thoughts, and perception shape the world, rather than there being one true reality. This course will explore the fundamentals of sleep, the fundamentals of navigating emotions, and the intersection between the two. Specifically, you will learn the basics of human sleep science, the principles of a type of psychotherapy called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and how CBT tools can be applied to sleep difficulties. Break-out sessions within each lecture provide opportunities for students to ask questions and to discuss a topic in greater depth. The course will highlight the mind body connection and serve as an introduction to behavioral sleep medicine. Students will have the opportunity to complete their own project examining a sleep-wake connection of interest.

    "courseDescr": "This is a Cardinal Course certified by the Haas Center for Public Service. Through a contemplative approach, this course cultivates students' capacity to take skillful action to address climate change. Effective engagement with the daunting complexity inherent in the climate crisis requires calm contemplative competence. The science of mindfulness, resilience, emotional intelligence, and compassion are explored in terms of their roles in supporting pro-environmental behaviors, policies, and programs for personal, public, and planetary health and well-being. Emerging research at the intersection of contemplation and climate science calls for individual insight and transformation to strengthen/restore/heal the human-earth relationship. Contemplative research indicates that the extension of mindful compassion beyond oneself can improve health at the public and planetary level, in addition to the individual level. Contemplative practices effective for promoting mental health in relation to eco-despair and eco-anxiety are addressed (including but not limited to nature-based centering, resilience-building mindfulness and loving kindness meditations, forest bathing, qigong, reflections on human-earth interconnectedness, and gratitude journaling.) Contemplative practices can prevent the burnout, avoidance, and disturbance of daily functioning that can arise from eco-anxiety. Moreover, research indicates contemplative practices can sustain altruistic behaviors that enhance mutual flourishing of people and the planet. Through study of contemplative neuroscience and behavioral science, students will develop/deepen their abilities for awareness, self-modulation, equanimity, self-transcendence, and compassion in caring for Earth. These skills will be discussed and applied to public health and climate change for effective behavioral action in a final class project. Modes of inquiry and class activities include contemplative, scientific, indigenous, artistic, verbal, visual, kinesthetic, sensory, emotional, spiritual, intellectual, social, and relational. Through diverse learning experiences, students will develop the empathy, discernment, and wisdom necessary for initiating and implementing solutions to the climate crisis.

Social media companies have faced scandals over user privacy, hate speech, and political manipulation. Other examples abound, across industries and around the globe. \"Don't be evil\" (Google's one-time slogan) may be one motivation for these companies, but something more mundane is also at work: many companies believe they will do well, financially, if they do good, ethically. This course considers questions such as: What does it mean for a company to \"do good?\", Should it care?, When does it serve a company's interest to take costly action to address human rights, labor, and environmental concerns?, and What tactics have activists used to shift public opinion, media frames, and the law, and thereby change companies' incentives?

Data Studio is open to the Stanford community. DBDS faculty are available to provide assistance with biomedical research questions. The educational goal is to provide data science consultation training for students and postdoctoral fellows interested in biomedical data science. Most sessions are Workshops that provide an extensive and in-depth consultation for a Medical School researcher based on research questions, data, statistical models, and other material prepared by the researcher with the aid of our facilitator. Experts in the area across campus are invited to attend and contribute to the brainstorming. During the Workshop, the researcher solicits advice from the panel of DBDS faculty consultants about the project, goals, and needs. The remaining sessions are Office Hours that provide brief and focused consultations based on a single research question. After both types of sessions, the facilitator helps with immediate action items and provides a summary of the discussion. The faculty demonstrate skills required of practicing biomedical consultants: exposure to biomedical and health science applications, identification of questions related to data science, selection or development of appropriate statistical and analytic approaches to answer research needs. Students are required to attend the sessions, participate in the discussion, and prepare a formal written report about one of the Workshops. May be repeated for credit.

But the same men are also police officers, militiamen, guild members, and soldiers. They can also do any of these things part-time. Why and how do men participate in violent groups? What happens when states cooperate with these groups, suppress them, or attempt to use them? And why are these groups so startlingly like one another, within many different polities and during many different times? This course will analyze political interactions in terms of contested negotiations around male interpersonal violence. It will explore these negotiations through groups of what Charles Tilly called \"violence specialists:\" soldiers, the police, thugs, criminals, etc. In many times and places, these men were and are a \"labor pool\" of violence who offer security and muscle; and who also turn to criminal activity. The relationships of violence specialists to states can be cooperative or ambivalent as well as antagonistic¿or networks of these men can make up the state itself. The political challenge of violent men who are embedded in the rest of society - at once of it and outsiders to it - will always be with us. It is important for issues like post-Soviet states, the spike in violence during the Covid plague and its equally sudden decline, the militarization of police, and the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's Syria.

In the Winter quarter it will meet three hours per week. In the Spring quarter, it will meet ONLY FOR SIX WEEKS for four hours per week--for 3 units of course credit. During those six weeks, the course will meet on Tuesday and Thursday. Exactly which five weeks the course will meet will be announced during the Winter quarter. This will involve scheduling with outside guests, but I will make every effort to schedule those six weeks for the first half of the quarter. Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters. All of the first quarter will be spent in a traditional classroom setting but with untraditional materials. Much of the course material will consist of case studies of business transactions (and no case law). We will use those case studies to analyze the economics underlying a wide range of business transactions and the contractual terms and structures used to respond to underlying economic challenges. During the second quarter, we will explore deals in greater detail by studying five complex transactions in full. For this part of the course, students will be divided into groups and will be assigned one of the five deals. Each group will give a presentation of its deal to the class, and in the following class, a lawyer, banker or other participant in the deal will come to class to present the deal based on his or her experience. We study five new deals each year. Deals we have studied over the years have included movie financings, biotech alliances, venture capital financings, cross-border joint ventures, private equity investments, corporate reorganizations, and more. Special Instructions: Students who have not taken the course in the Winter cannot register for it in the Spring, and those who took it in the Winter must register for it in the Spring. There is no exam in Winter Term. An In-School exam will be given at the conclusion of the course in the Spring Term.

    "courseDescr": "This course will support students in designing or refining a proposal for a community-engaged research project. Unlike \"traditional\" forms of research, community-engaged research uses a social justice lens to ensure research outcomes benefit communities most impacted by social inequities. This approach to research aims to alter the power relationship between \"researchers\" and \"researched\" by ensuring close collaboration with community partners in the design, conceptualization, and actualization of the research process. In this course, students will be guided through each phase of designing a community-engaged research project. This involves forming a successful community partnership, generating meaningful research questions, and selecting means of collecting and analyzing data that best answer the research questions and support community partners. Additionally, the course will support students to develop a grounding in the theory and practice of community-engaged research while also considering the ethical questions and challenges involved. By the end of the course, students will have developed a robust community-engaged research design that can be used to craft a research proposal for various summer funding opportunities, including the Chappell Lougee Scholarship, the Community-Based Research Fellowship, Cardinal Quarter Fellowships, and Major Grants, among others. Please note that while the course prepares students to develop strong proposals, it does not guarantee funding. The skills gained will also benefit students in any academic year, including those who may wish to pursue community-engaged theses or capstone projects.",

The course will focus on the multidisciplinary collaboration required to deliver high-quality burn care and the paramount goal of delivering high-equity care to all populations including the indigent populations of the San Francisco Bay Area. While much of the preclinical years are focused on didactic and physiology, this course will be patient facing and integrate themes of applied clinical care and health equity. During the weekly seminar, students will 1) interview a burn survivor in clinic, 2) round in the Burn ICU, and 3) discuss a selected reading. Reading topics will include critical care for burn patients, acute surgical/wound care, multidisciplinary burn care, rehabilitative burn care, scar reconstruction, burn prevention, health systems design for burn care, and health equity disparities in burn care. The course includes open discussion sessions to allow opportunities for reflection and discourse with the challenges presented in Burn Care. Importantly this class will focus on the Regional Burn Center as a public health prevention organization and healthcare delivery entity for the entire San Francisco Bay Area. This includes a focus on what distinguishes safety-net hospitals from non-profit and for-profit hospitals. The course is offered during autumn, winter and spring quarters. It may be taken throughout the entire academic year as a longitudinal experience if the student wishes to fully immerse in the world of burn care and engage in Burn Center quality improvement, public health initiatives, and/or research. In particular, students who enroll in multiple quarters will get exposure to acute and reconstructive burn surgery in the operating room. This seminar is ideal for students interested in future careers in public health, plastic surgery, general surgery, and health policy research. Students must secure their own transportation to travel 18 miles south of the Stanford campus to the Burn Center. Parking is free. Non-medical students interested in the course should contact the instructor and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Students taking this course for 2 units will be required to produce a deliverable (one-page reflection or brief slide deck) on their topic of choice at the conclusion of the course.

We will examine how international institutions and treaties attempt to regulate environmental issues such as climate change, ozone depletion, marine resource management, and Arctic conservation - often under conditions of scientific uncertainty and competing economic interests. Students will engage with case studies that highlight the tensions between environmental regulation, trade, investment, and development. Through a combination of simulations, debates, and policy analysis, we will investigate questions such as: How do governments balance economic growth with environmental protection? What mechanisms exist to provide scientific guidance to policymakers? What role do corporations and advocacy groups play in shaping environmental policy? Drawing on political science and environmental sciences, this course will introduce students to key theories and real-world challenges in international environmental governance.

We will consider how factories, railways, and telegraphs helped construct modern states and new kinds of citizens. From there, we will trace how everything from Cold War cybernetics and Soviet centralization to Silicon Valley libertarianism recoded political life through algorithms and data. Throughout the course we will ask: what kinds of knowledge count as expertise? Who decides how a system should function and for whom? Technology will be treated as a central force in shaping what modernity is and what has been promised. We will explore how ideas of rationality, control, futurity, and innovation have been embedded in everything from computer systems to climate models. At the same time, we will examine the cultural and emotional dimensions of technological change, in particular its illusions, enchantments, and unintended consequences.

The venture capital ecosystem is going through a dramatic cycle as US venture capital investment dropped from a record high of over $350B in 2021 to less than half that level ($165B) in 2023. We then witnessed a slight recovery of VC investment to $215B in 2024. As we navigate through tariffs, inflation and an uncertain economy in 2025 and 2026, venture capitalists are likely to retain the power at the negotiating table.

Many investors and entrepreneurs look at this chaotic environment as a time to return to safe harbors by reducing risk. We suggest a more adventurous strategy. Our course offers alternatives to what many advisors consider `best practices'. Our goal is to improve your ability to create or invest in a breakthrough idea. Many of these concepts come from the course textbook, Pattern Breakers, by Mike Maples, Jr and Peter Ziebelman. The course is designed to give you the tactical tools to proactively and confidently navigate this chaotic environment. You will hear from over 15 investors and half dozen entrepreneurs.

The course is designed to complement other popular GSB courses about entrepreneurship such as Startup Garage, Formation of New Ventures, and Lean Launchpad. Our course gives you that tactical edge with a special combination of two class projects, guest speakers and case-based instruction. You will be able to apply what you learn as we (and the guest speakers) offer candid and instant feedback. The course is fast paced with very current content. Notably, students are permitted to use the same business idea in our course's team project that they use for a different course (with instructor permission). If you do not have a business idea or market sector interest, we will team you with another student with similar interests. We offer class topics that are typically not covered in other business school courses - such as how to find and use the power of early stage advisors and board members in building and funding a company, how to find that ideal co-founder and figure out the equity split amongst the founding team, and what do VCs say behind closed doors at the VC's partners' meeting after the founder gives their funding pitch? The course attracts students from diverse backgrounds (we intentionally reserve 10 seats for graduate students from outside the GSB). Students range in experience from serial entrepreneurs to students who are experimenting with entrepreneurship for the first time. We also see students with significant investment experience share their start-up investor experience as they add to the class dynamic.",

    "courseDescr": "This experiential learning course explores why entrepreneurial efforts inside governments succeed or fail. For students interested in entrepreneurship, this setting offers one of the most demanding environments for building and scaling new organizations. This topic matters because government innovation shapes public outcomes, national security, and long-term technological competitiveness. Over the last decade, the U.S. government has created more than 100 innovation organizations such as digital service teams and rapid capability offices to advance emerging technologies. Yet while some of these \"government startups\" achieve meaningful breakthroughs, others stall without widely understood reasons, revealing how little is known about entrepreneurship inside government. Students learn how to overcome organizational inertia, build legitimacy, navigate resource dependencies, establish effective governance, and structure organizations that can adapt and pivot. Together, these principles form a practical framework for improving performance. Each team studies a real government exploratory unit, essentially a startup inside the public sector, and explains its performance using course concepts. Student teams conduct rigorous research grounded in external interviews and produce publicly available reports with recommendations for relevant agencies. The course is intended for graduate and undergraduate students interested in entrepreneurship, national security, public policy, emerging technologies, and innovation.

Over 50% of the world's GDP is generated on the Transatlantic Marketplace. U.S. companies rely on the EU market for more than half of their global foreign profits, and U.S. investment in the EU is currently three times greater than U.S. investment in the whole of Asia. In recent years, this has tremendously heightened the need for a sound understanding of the legal system of the EU, especially for business and technology lawyers. Responding to this need, this course will, first, examine the internationally unique legal system of the EU as such, as it is applicable to any field of substantive and procedural EU law. Thus, we will look at the legal nature and the different sources of EU law and its relationship with the national law of the EU Member States, including European human rights and fundamental rights protection standards. We will cover the relevant EU law enforcement actions including state liability issues for breach of EU law as well as the jurisdiction of both European Courts and relevant remedies in national courts. Secondly, we will explore the legal framework governing business activities in the EU, from the perspective of a business entity as an internationally operating actor in a European business environment. In this context, we will focus on the most essential fields of EU business law, i.e. (a) the four fundamental economic freedoms of the European Internal Market for goods, services, capital, and persons (enterprises, workforce, immigration), including the legal and economic implications of Brexit, (b) EU competition (antitrust) law, and (c) the new digital European Internal Market and EU data protection and privacy laws. Special attention will be given to the question how companies established outside the EU can efficiently use EU business law to pursue their interests in the EU.

We engage with these traditions through phenomenology, exploring the multi-sensorial modes coded in the cultural experience of these structures and objects. We also engage with the art of Greece and Rome but we de-center their position and uncover the principles that govern their sensorial experience. Experiencing Early Global Art uncovers shared themes that underscore the premodern artistic production. These themes include bodies and performance; archive and memory; sustainability and repurposing; fluidity and permanence; conversion and mobility. \"Early\" relates to time conceptualized from a non-western-centric perspective and avoids the pejorative associations with backwardness of the term \"premodern.\" The adoption of the term \"Early Global\" here is inspired by the recent conceptual work done by UCLA in renaming their research center of Medieval and Renaissance Studies into Center for Early Global Studies.",

Students perform experiments that use optics, lasers, and electronics to measure fundamental constants of nature, perform measurements at the atomic level, and analyze results. Goals include developing an understanding of measurement precision and accuracy through concepts of spectral-analysis of coherent signals combined with noise. We explore the fundamental limits to measurement set by thermal noise at finite temperature, as well as optical shot-noise in photo-detection that sets the standard quantum limit in detecting light. Spectroscopy of light emitted from atoms reveals the quantum nature of atomic energy levels, and when combined with theoretical models provides information on atomic structure and fundamental constants of nature (e.g. the fine structure constant that characterizes the strength of all electro-magnetic interactions, and the ratio of the electron mass to the proton mass, me/mp. Experiments may include laser spectroscopy to determine the interatomic potential, effective spring constant, and binding energy of a diatomic molecule, or measure the speed of light. This course will provide hands-on experience with semiconductor diode lasers, basic optics, propagation and detection of optical beams, and related electronics and laboratory instrumentation. For lab notebooks the class uses an integrated online environment for data analysis, curve fitting, (system is based on Jupyter notebooks, Python, and document preparation).

In the modern corporation, everything is rented: owners, capital, C-suite, labor, assets, even the legal system. In such a world, it appears pointless to build an institution- a social arrangement that is stable and long-lived, created and maintained to serve a shared purpose that cannot be achieved by individuals acting alone. Indeed, in a world transfixed by the allure of new technology, institutions are viewed as obstacles that must be routed around. Or disrupted. Or destroyed. This course takes a different view: institutions are essential to a well-functioning society. In the commercial world, institutions are what we refer to as enduring enterprises. The course will explore why and how to turn a company into an institution, whether that company is a family firm (the primary form of enduring enterprise), startup, growth business, professional services partnership, or legacy corporation. It is co-taught by Leo Linbeck III, Lecturer since 2005 at the GSB and President and CEO of Aquinas Companies, LLC, and Thomas Brenninkmeijer, a leader in his family business Cofra Holding. The course is intended for three main audiences: (1) Students from a family firm who may or may not want to work at that firm. (2) Students who are interested in building or leading or buying an enduring non-family firm. (3) Students who want to explore a view of business that is markedly different from the 'Silicon Valley model.'

    "courseDescr": "This course addresses the role of the federal courts in the American system of federalism and separation of powers, as well as their role in the development of substantive federal law and constitutional rights. A central premise of the course is that the institutional, political, and constitutional features of federal litigation cannot be understood without engaging the historical and theoretical context, especially the social, political, and legal movements in response to which the federal courts have developed and related assumptions about structural constitutional theory (including federalism, supremacy, separation of powers, and judicial review). Thus while many of the traditional aspects of federal court jurisprudence will be covered (e.g., federal common law including implied rights of action, justiciability doctrines and other doctrines of restraint, congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create \"legislative courts\" outside of Article III, Supreme Court review of judgments, state sovereign immunity, litigating against the government, and federal habeas corpus), the doctrine will be assessed from an interdisciplinary perspective, including social, political, and theoretical accounts that reveal how the courts and ordinary Americans have come to understand the distinctive role of the federal courts, as well as claims for expansion or contraction of their powers. The course is recommended for students interested in pursuing a career in litigation, government service, and/or judicial clerkships. Special Instructions: In Winter 2026 the Federal Courts class will be capped at 45 students and conducted in small group sessions of 5 students per group. Required class participation includes (a) weekly pre-recorded lectures introducing assigned materials, and (b) weekly small group sessions. The small group sessions are led by Professor Spaulding every week. Some groups will have their sessions during the regularly scheduled hours of the course, but most groups will meet in sessions scheduled during other mutually convenient time slots each week. (Scheduling software will be used to generate time slots for each group for the quarter and students' availability will be solicited). The readings and pre-recorded lectures must be completed before attending small group sessions. The small group sessions run approximately 70 minutes each week and will be led by Professor Spaulding in person assuming health regulations permit. If this is not possible, they will be conducted online. The goal of this format is to create an engaging, interactive, and intellectually rigorous setting for exploration of the course materials and themes. Note that class time is not used for basic exposition of cases -- students are expected to have used the readings and lectures to internalize the basic doctrine. We will instead use our sessions to focus on the hardest doctrinal and structural constitutional questions presented by the cases. Each group will cover a common set of 'hard questions,' so careful preparation is obligatory. There is usually some time for brief Q&A each week, but the sessions are not conducted as open-ended tutorials. Although none is a prerequisite, students generally report that it is useful to have taken some or all of the following classes: Advanced Civ Pro, Administrative Law, Con Law II, Criminal Procedure, Remedies. Elements used in grading: Grading will be based on attendance, participation, a short paper, and a take home final exam. Interested students should fill out a consent form indicating understanding of and interest in this format. Course Planning Note: The law school offers a standard format, open enrollment course in another quarter, so if you are not interested in the small group format or can't take the risk of consent admission in the winter quarter, please plan your academic year and course selection accordingly.

It is pre-approved to count toward majors in Public Policy, Political Science, and Human Environmental Systems and may be petitioned to count towards other majors and degrees. As society faces major challenges, democracies and 'free market' capitalism appear to be in crisis. This interdisciplinary course will deepen your understanding of the key institutions in our system and the complex interactions between corporations, governments, and individuals. The course draws on insights from multiple areas of scholarship and practice in the social sciences (particularly Economics and Political Science), business, and law to understand how this interaction produces the rules and outcomes that shape our world. The course aims to help students become savvier in their interactions with our economic and political systems and understand better the governance issues that determine how well institutions in the private and public sectors serve us. Specific topics include financial decisions, financial markets, banks and institutional investors; corporations and corporate governance; political economy, the rule of law, and the role and functioning of the media. The course is analytical but not heavily mathematical. We will discuss current events regularly throughout the course and connect the material to specific themes such as climate change, social justice and economic inequality. Students will have the opportunity to explore a case of their choosing in more depth through group final projects. Visitors with relevant expertise and experience will enrich our class discussion.",

What are the key financial institutions that lend, provide liquidity and make markets. What role does the government play through regulation, monetary policy, bailouts and other interventions during financial crises. First we teach basic principles of modern finance. Then we focus on recent developments (digital currencies provided by central banks or the private sector, climate finance.) The course qualifies for the Economics major (BA and BS) and requires little prior exposure to finance.

    "courseDescr": "Most GSB students will encounter distressed situations at various points during their careers, in their capacity as executives, business owners, investors, advisors, lenders, customers, suppliers, or competitors. Knowing how to handle these situations is a critical skill in business. Financial restructuring is the process by which distressed companies, and their key stakeholders, use in-court and out-of-court tools and methods to renegotiate their key contracts for the purpose of rehabilitation. In contrast with operational restructuring, financial restructuring focuses on resolving problems on the 'right-hand side' of a company's balance sheet - its debt and non-debt liabilities. This course provides an intensive overview of financial restructuring techniques and processes from the perspectives of distressed firms and their key stakeholders. It is intended for those who plan careers in general management, private equity, entrepreneurship, credit and special situations investing, commercial and investment banking, turnaround management, or financial advisory services. While it is primarily a finance course, it incorporates interdisciplinary elements including negotiations, game theory, strategy, and business law. Enrolling students should be reasonably comfortable with financial analysis, valuation techniques, and basic financial modeling.",

    "courseDescr": "This short course (five weeks) is an introduction to the field of political ecology (PE), an interdisciplinary social science that examines how political, economic, and social forces shape environmental issues and access to resources. Scholars in the field emphasize the role of power, colonial legacies, and uneven development in environmental degradation, and situate environmental issues within historical and structural contexts. Feminist political ecology (FPE) expands this lens by integrating gender, identity, and embodiment into environmental analysis, highlighting how gendered power relations intersect with race, class, and place to shape environmental knowledge, labor, and access to resources. Together, political ecology and the sub-field of feminist political ecology push for more inclusive, holistic, and transformative ecological understandings and politics. This seminar-style course will equip students with foundational knowledge in PE and FPE, drawing on foundational works, short lectures, class discussions, and reflections to help students situate their own scholarship within a political ecology lens. Classes largely will be discussion-based, with occasional lectures, small group work, and in-class exercises. Students are expected to complete all readings and associated assignments in advance of each class. At the end of this course, students should have a sound understanding of the field of political ecology, including the ability to describe the field's theories and methods, major frameworks and constructs, and key scholars.

This burst of new ideas was intertwined with some of the darkest chapters in Europe's history: the enslavement, subjection and exploitation of vast populations across the globe as Europe's imperial domination expanded and deepened. This course will explore how virtually all the most consequential ideas emerging from now canonical thinkers - on human freedom and autonomy, reason, popular self-determination, property rights, civility, liberal toleration, equality, empirical social sciences and much else - arose as direct answers to the new epistemic, moral and political challenges of empire and colonial conquest. The world of empire indelibly shaped and created the intellectual legacy that informs modern social theory on a global scale - both its internal critiques, its liberal, and emancipatory potentials, as well as its many illiberal, racist and exclusionary strands and impulses. Each section has original texts, commentaries, and background readings that place these texts in their deeper historical setting. Many of these commentaries trace how practical theories of 'lower' or minor selves - the subject people of the colonies, slaves, and other - were integral to the very development of ideas of the modern, autonomous and reasonable self in the western world.

How do gender gaps in political attitudes and behavior vary across racial groups and class status? Does sharing a common gender identity influence the relationship between Democratic and Republican women? What is the role of race, gender, and factors like having a traditional household profile in the evaluation of candidates and how do these factors influence decisions to run for office or other forms of political engagement?

    "courseDescr": "This graduate seminar explores the dynamic and contested terrain of global environmental governance, with a focus on the politics, institutions and actors that shape responses to climate change and other transboundary environmental challenges. We will review the literatures on the environment in international relations, political economy, and comparative politics. The course engages with foundational debates and emerging research on the design and effectiveness of international environmental regimes, the expanding role of non-state actors (NGOs, scientists, firms, sub-national governments), and the interplay between domestic and global policymaking on environmental issues. Core concepts include distributive conflicts and collective action problems, the challenges of governing over long periods, and the politics of target setting. A key objective of the course is to help students initiate one of their own research projects. In doing this, students will gain experience in 1) identifying a clear empirical puzzle, 2) proposing a research design to causally identify an answer to this puzzle, 3) collecting and analyzing relevant empirical evidence, and 4) presenting the work. The course is reading-intensive and discussion-driven. It is designed for PhD and advanced Master's students in environmental social science, political science, public policy, and related disciplines who aim to conduct research in the field of climate and environmental politics. Highly motivated upper-level undergraduates with relevant preparation are encouraged to speak with the professor before enrolling. Prior coursework in international relations, public policy, or environmental politics is recommended.",

How can people, from whatever walk of life, identify and utilize levers of power to ty to shift the larger system? What is a system, and how do systems behave? To answer these questions and analyze how today's world came into being and where it might be headed, this course explores geopolitics and geoeconomics, institutions and technologies, citizenship and leadership. We examine how our world works to understand the limits but also the possibilities of individual and collective agency, the phenomenon of perverse and unintended consequences, and ultimately, the nature of power. Our goal is to investigate not just how to conceive of a smart policy, but how its implementation might unfold. In sum, this course aims to combine strategic analysis and tactical agility.",

    "courseDescr": "Recent advances in health technologies - incorporating innovations like robotics, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and smart sensors - have raised expectations of a dramatic impact on health outcomes across the world. However, bringing innovative technologies to populations who have been traditionally underserved has proven challenging, limiting their impact and in many cases exacerbating inequities. This course explores critical questions regarding the implementation and impact of technological innovations to improve health outcomes and achieve greater health equity both domestically and globally. Through a combination of lectures, discussions, and guest lectures from thought leaders, this course considers examples of technologies that have been 'successful', as well as those that have 'failed'. The course also explores the disproportionately negative impact of climate change on lower income populations, and the potential role of technology in addressing that. MED 232 students will think critically to consider conditions under which technologies reach scale and have a positive impact on global health outcomes. Students will also have an opportunity to work on real-world projects with domestic and international organizations, each of which will focus on the potential opportunity for health technology and consider approaches to ensure its social impact at scale. This course is taught by Dr. Anurag Mairal, Adjunct Professor of Medicine and the Director of Global Outreach Programs at Stanford Mussallem Center for Biodesign, Dr. Krista Donaldson, Director of Innovation to Impact at Stanford Mussallem Center for Biodesign, and Dr. Michele Barry, Director of the Center for Innovation in Global Health. This course is open to all students, but graduate students, medical students, and undergraduate students who are in their third or fourth year are preferred. Students should have some experience in global health, health equity, technology innovation, or health technology implementation. This course is available for two or three units. Students enrolling in the course for a third unit will work on the group project described above, and have additional assignments, including an outline, presentation, and paper related to the group project.

Since these values are embedded in larger (often socially inherited) ethical frameworks, this course introduces prominent frameworks, including utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics. The course highlights the key advantages and challenges of each theory, the ways in which they shape a designer's ethos, and how they influence our conceptions of harm and justifiable value tradeoffs. The course emphasizes ethical reasoning as a foundational design skill, guiding students to (i) evaluate competing ethical perspectives on human problems, (ii) adapt and apply theoretical principles and concepts specifically in the domain of design, and (iii) to defend their ethical judgments about design choices using moral theories and frameworks.

Perhaps you have heard the Japanese language described as \"difficult\" or \"complex,\" \"polite\" or \"indirect,\" or even \"ancient\" or \"poetic.\" Perhaps a gendered aspect or an abundance of scripts garner attention. Given the many representations of language in Japan in social media, popular discourse, or even your own language classes, this course asks, what are the stories that are told about language in Japan, and how do we evaluate those stories? The course draws on readings from diverse fields, including linguistic anthropology, linguistics, cultural history, and literary history. The course is divided into three parts. The first part introduces theories on the relationship between language, ideology, and power. This part helps us identify discourses about what a given language is and what it should be, while exploring the consequences of those discourses. The second part focuses on language ideology and policy in Japanese history, with particular attention to script reform, dialect management, and state language pedagogy. The third part connects the history of language ideologies to present-day language topics, including gendered language, formality, the status of minority languages, and second language acquisition. Throughout, we ask what discourses persist, and why? What theoretical and epistemological tools might we employ to critique those discourses?

Have you ever questioned why so many people fear and dislike mathematics, or other subjects? Or, why students of color, women and girls are systematically excluded from mathematics and often feel they do not \"belong\" in STEM? In this seminar we will consider seminal research on math learning in K-12 classrooms, and will introduce some ideas from data science. We will spend time investigating cases of teaching and learning, through watching videos and visiting schools. This seminar is for those who are interested in education, and who would like to learn about ways to help students (and maybe yourselves?) learn and enjoy mathematics and data. If you have had bad math experiences and would like to understand them - and put them behind you - this seminar will be particularly good for you.

The course aims to demonstrate how memory manifests differently when shaped by natural variation, brain injury, or psychological trauma. These real-world examples often defy neat theoretical models, revealing memory as far more complex and nuanced than textbooks suggest. Discussions weave through themes of memory's relationship to identity, its role in law and justice, and collective memories across generations, inviting deeper reflection on what it truly means to remember and to forget.

Much of that capital investment will directed towards new builds, or retrofits, of major capital projects, whether using technologies that are commercial today or new technologies. This course aims to give students a very practical and detailed introduction to the opportunities and challenges of developing and financing large-scale low-carbon capital projects, such as grid solar, on-shore wind, off-shore wind, geothermal, grid storage (battery, pumped storage, hydrogen, gravity or other), biomass power, hydropower, nuclear, carbon capture and storage, direct air capture (DAC), biofuels, hydrogen and ammonia (of any 'color' that is low carbon), industrial low-carbon heat (including heat storage) and industrial decarbonization generally. Each of the instructors has decades of hands-on experience in developing and financing major capital projects. The process of developing and financing major capital projects is inherently very multidisciplinary - including engineering, business, finance, legal, tax and (often) international relations principles. The course will start at a high level, covering the emissions landscape, policy framework, markets, and main technologies. Then we will dive much deeper into such key tasks as permitting; engineering and resource studies; project pro forma models; successfully negotiating project construction contracts and output sales contracts; arranging the financial terms and legal provisions of bank or bond debt financing; maximizing returns to equity; and monetizing tax and other governmental incentives. Students should be eager to engage in a multi-disciplinary approach both in terms of how to think about the subject matter and in terms of interacting with fellow students who bring a different academic and or work experience than their own.

The coverage of industrial policy and national security is not clearly delineated, and more and more we observe an overlap between the two. This is not a re-run of past experience, as the justification for measures adopted is (almost consistently) the protection of national security. From Biden's subsidies to chips producers and export restrictions towards Huawei to Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, the US has been at the forefront of this discussion. Alas, investing in national security triggers the \"security dilemma\" as others mimic similar policies. We will ask whether the world trading system is well-equipped to deal with these measures that test its resilience, and what are the alternatives, in case the regime collapses. Elements used in grading: Short essay exam.

In this course, we'll try to answer that question by reading and analyzing two key works of Seneca's prose: De brevitate vitae (On the Shortness of Life) and De otio (On Leisure). Both dialogues address major existential questions that run throughout Seneca's philosophical writing. De brevitate vitae asks why we waste time even though it is our most precious resource - and how we might reclaim it. In De otio, Seneca explores the tension between civic engagement and private withdrawal, arguing that the latter can be not only legitimate but even more beneficial than the former. Our focus will be on the relationship between style and thought in these works. Through close analysis of vocabulary and syntax, we'll examine how Seneca's style is not merely ornamental but central to his philosophical vision. In doing so, the course aims to help you develop a more nuanced command of Latin: moving beyond basic comprehension toward a deeper understanding of stylistic and rhetorical technique in literary prose.

At a minimum, it covers aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Other crimes, such as ecocide, are also sometimes included. This course (i) asks foundational questions about the nature of international criminal law, (ii) considers domestic and international jurisdictional authority on these issues, (iii) wrestles with debates about the scope and limits of the substantive crimes themselves, (iv) explores and evaluates the scope of individual responsibility for these crimes, and (v) considers legal and political obstacles to the realization of international criminal justice. In addition to developing students' understanding of the specific regime of international criminal law, this course will offer an opportunity to reflect critically on that regime, while advancing skills in legal interpretation, analysis, and argument, particularly in relation to international law.

It is very important to note that when you decide to take this course, you make an explicit contract to be actively involved. ATTENDANCE: Because of the highly interactive nature of this course, it is very important that all students attend all sessions. Missing class, class T-group, evening T-group, or any portion of the weekend for an unexcused absence will negatively impact your course grade (as much as a full grade level for each absence). Attendance at the first class is required for all sections and an unexcused absence from the first class will result in your final grade being reduced. Some sections of the 2-day/week version of the course allow one unexcused absence on a non-T-group day with no grade penalty, but this does not apply to the first class.

From studies that consider objects as agents to technical considerations of the physical properties of artifacts to thick descriptions of human attachments to and uses of items of personal or collective significance, this course will look at both a variety of object classifications and a range of theoretical and methodological approaches.

Our particular focus is on inequality research - research that seeks to identify differences, disparities or inequities between groups of people. Through course readings and case studies we will consider the promise and pitfalls of making group comparisons: although researchers often do this work because they want to challenge inequity or alleviate inequality, depending on how it is executed and interpreted, such research also can do harm (inadvertently or otherwise). We will explore these challenges across a range of applications: from practices of race correction in medicine to counting families and households in the census. Through course assignments and activities, we will practice spotting common problems and proposing solutions. By the end of the quarter, students will be better positioned to both critique existing research and conduct more responsible analyses of their own.",

We will also discuss such the role of plea bargaining, novel theories of prosecution and defense, the role of different non-lawyer actors in the system and so much more. The class will meet twice a week for 90 minutes. Classes will alternate between lectures and on-your-feet exercises, where a group of students will be \"on panel,\" but in a slightly unusual way---they will be assigned roles in a scenario, and asked to carry out those roles by arguing for release or confinement at an arraignment, cross examining a witness, conducting voir dire or negotiating a proffer agreement...all with the participation and support of their fellow classmates, who will serve as judges, jurors, and, occasionally, clients.

    "courseDescr": "When we represent our experience today, we do so as much through images as words. When we seek to persuade, we offer photographs, charts, and graphs. When we witness misconduct, we pull out our smartphones. Social media has emerged as a powerful court of public opinion. AI has made it easy to generate realistic images out of thin air. And as images saturate the representation of our experience, they are increasingly part of legal practice. The power of an image often lies in its apparent simplicity: we know it when we see it. But how much of what we see is produced by the biases and expectations -- the habits of viewing -- that we bring to the encounter? What is left out when an infographic distills information for us? Lawyers and judges have tended to treat certain kinds of images as unmediated representations of reality, even though neuroscience, empirical research, and cultural theory all refute this so-called reality effect. Such naïve realism maps on to an ideal of definitive proof embedded in the adversary system. It also haunts our efforts to adapt legal practice to visual persuasion in ways that are consistent with our rule of law values. This interdisciplinary seminar tracks the legal reception of images from confusion about the admissibility of photographs in the late 19th century (is it like a drawing? is it like eyewitness testimony?) to the use of film in the IMT trial at Nuremberg in 1945-1946 and the proliferation of televised trials and trial-themed entertainment in the 1990s to the frequent and strategic deployment of visual media in pretrial and litigation practice today. We will also consider the role of images in areas of doctrine (like privacy, qualified immunity, and freedom of speech) and applications in practice (like contracts and client communications).

And, despite the global adoption of the Law of Armed Conflict - also known as international humanitarian law, or the laws of war - notable cases of atrocities in places such as Sudan, Ukraine, and Gaza continue to mark headlines on a near-daily basis. This course examines the role of the Law of Armed Conflict in both preventing and permitting violence against civilians in wartime. The course will examine legal, normative, and ethical prohibitions against harming noncombatants, how such prohibitions have developed, and whether - and how - such prohibitions can be effective in preventing atrocities in war.",

This fundamentally transforms the job of lawyers engaged in international business and other forms of exchange. This seminar will explore the process of globalization, de-globalization and its consequences, particularly for U.S. transactional lawyers. US relations with China will serve as the most important bilateral manifestation of the trend and its legal, financial, and geopolitical implications although the course will touch upon other regions as well. The format will comprise weekly lectures and discussions with readings and short writing assignments or group projects. The first third of the seminar will explore the broader phenomenon of deglobalization and its general implications, including such topics as due diligence, financial and commercial law and its enforcement, and ownership of raw data; the second, the tools available to address specific problems such as legal uncertainty and risk mitigation; and the third, case studies showing how those tools are effectively, or ineffectively, applied in the real world. The seminar will conclude with exercises designed to give students the opportunity to identify problems and devise remedial strategies. The specific problems will stem from topics that appear in the news, which will demonstrate the immediate relevance of what the course covers. Students will be evaluated based on their periodic short papers and the quality of their class participation.

The introductory materials are intended to provide a basis for students to complete a research paper related to higher education; the goal is for each student to develop a paper that could lead, eventually, to a publication. In the first classes, students will be introduced to the basics about the higher education sector. Given the expectation that serious research will begin immediately when the quarter starts, readings will be relatively light, and will focus on the leadership, governance structure, legal and regulatory environment, and financing of research universities. Then we will devote some sessions to topics in higher education with each student taking the lead discussing the issue with the class--anything from present controversies (changing financial models, academic freedom, political control) to key legal issues (Title VI, antitrust, athletics) to historical topics. Students are encouraged to choose a topic that will advance the research they are conducting for their paper. In the final weeks of the seminar, students will present their research and the thesis of their paper. The class will discuss and provide constructive suggestions. As noted, the core requirement of this seminar is the production of a research paper that could eventually be published. By week 3 of the seminar, students will choose a topic and thesis of their research paper--a question their paper will answer, or a claim their paper will make. An outline will be due in week 5, and a draft will be due in week 9. The final paper of ~ 20 pages will be due on March 30, 2026.

From the Biblical Solomon to medieval troubadours to 19th-century lieder to Taylor Swift, love has remained a perennial focus for composers. But ideas of love---not to mention related things like marriage, family, sex, gender, sexuality, and happiness---have changed radically. How have love songs revealed or resisted or disguised these transformations? What have they taught us about love? What else have they taught us? Can they be trusted? Do they really speak of love, or only of desire? Do they tell us what these experiences are? Or rather what we want them to be? Are they maybe even speaking about entirely other matters? We will attend closely to individual songs, listening for the details that evade more casual notice. We will also attend to large amounts of songs from a distance, looking for the patterns that only emerge from afar. We will enrich our theoretical perspectives by reading and discussing works of history, philosophy, and psychoanalysis.

What is liberty? How many kinds of liberty are there? Is there a difference between resistance and rebellion? Is tyranny a moral or constitutional problem? Does tyranny exist at all? What is the basis of political subjection and when is resistance justified? These are some of the questions that students will be invited to probe through the texts of such authors as Marsilius, Hobbes, Locke, Wollstonecraft, and to identify the ways in which these intellectuals grappled with them in polemical discourse.

What are the boundaries between history-writing and literary representations? Can literature allow a more nuanced and rich attachment to the past, and subsequently a different horizon for the future? This course will examine twentieth- and twenty-first century works of fiction, memoir, and historiography on the question of literature and representations of the past, considering thematic as well as theoretical aspects. Our focus will be the interplay between literature and history, with special attention to historical events and their various literary depictions, at times reading a literary work focused on an event alongside an historical account of that event. Four contexts - the Holocaust, the African American experience, postcolonialism, and the conflict in Israel-Palestine - will serve as cases in point.

The seminar includes open discussion, addressing questions about specific interactions with the child/adolescent or adult, diagnoses, and therapies used for treatment. Responses to students' questions invariably address evidence-based approaches to assessment and treatment of specific disorders, such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, autism, and attentional disorders. We also facilitate opportunities for the students to get involved in cutting-edge scientific research, networking/collaborating (including with medical students and faculty around the world) and attending professional conferences. The course is offered during autumn, winter and spring quarters and is intended as a longitudinal seminar to be taken continuously across these quarters. Medical students who cannot attend three quarters may enroll with permission of the instructor. Non-medical students interested in the course should contact the instructor.",

Students will find, read, present, and discuss key theoretical and empirical papers to examine how metacognition has been defined and studied across domains (e.g., perception, memory, numerical cognition, reasoning about competence and effort, social decision-making) and disciplines (e.g., developmental, cognitive, and comparative science). Importantly, this course will also invite students to adopt a meta-stance toward research on metacognition itself: Students will be encouraged to critically examine the methods, identify gaps in the literature, and explore promising directions for future research. This course welcomes PhD students in Psychology and related disciplines whose work would benefit from a deeper understanding of the human capacity for self-reflection.

The centerpiece result of the class is the completeness - and closely related compactness - of first-order logic, a result with a number of momentous consequences, some useful, some philosophically puzzling. We will then study a connection with game theory, whereby a certain type of game characterizes precisely the expressive power of first-order logic.

By the 1960s and '70s, modernist movements flourished in some African cities with support from new national governments, while socialist cultural policies often sought to modernize and nationalize local art practices, even as alarms began to sound over new patterns of authoritarianism, state collapse, and foreign intervention. Because classificatory orders in Africa were never so commanding as they tend to be in the West, modernism stands to be studied in this context through a cross-genre and multi-media lens that examines drawing, painting, and sculpture alongside performance, photography, and film, recognizing how distinctions between 'high' and 'popular' forms often blurred or were nonexistent.",

In other words, how money/capital change hands between agents over time, directly and through institutions. Material will be both quantitative and qualitative, yet always highly analytical with a focus on active learning - there will be an approximately equal emphasis on solving mathematical finance problems (e.g. bond or option pricing) and on policy analysis (e.g. monetary policy and financial regulation.)

    "courseDescr": "This policy lab is a two-quarter course that examines how law and policy should evolve to govern the rise of autonomous systems in outer space--from AI-assisted satellite operations to self-directed on-orbit servicing and collision-avoidance technologies. The lab's policy client is The Aerospace Corporation, a non-profit organization that advises the U.S. government on space enterprise and systems engineering issues. The lab situates the rise of AI-driven autonomy and related technological developments within the emerging \"New Space\" era. Private companies such as SpaceX, Planet, and Astroscale are transforming the once state-dominated domain of space into a crowded and commercially driven ecosystem. As of 2024, about 10,000 satellites orbit the Earth, a number projected by the European Space Agency to grow nearly tenfold by 2030. Once in orbit, these satellites must navigate a spinning web of over 140 million pieces of space debris, all of which are moving at velocities several times faster than a bullet. This rapid expansion has amplified concerns about the risk of a cascading collision chain--known as the Kessler Syndrome--that could render key orbital regions unusable for generations. In this context, spacecraft are becoming increasingly automated, leveraging AI in navigation, collision avoidance, and mission management. Yet, this also raises urgent questions about how to regulate accountability, transparency, and safety in an increasingly autonomous orbital environment. The lab will run for two quarters. Students will analyze how responsibility is assigned when AI acts autonomously in space, how autonomous systems can be verified as safe and auditable, and how post-incident investigation and enforcement should function. Throughout the lab, students will engage directly with a range of stakeholders, including industry, government, and research institutions, to assess current issues, test ideas, and refine policy analysis. The lab team will synthesize their findings into a comprehensive policy report outlining options and suggestions for governing AI in space. The course will be cross-listed and students selected based on the consent of the instructor. Only students who participated in the prior quarter's project will qualify to be admitted to the Spring quarter practicum. Cross-listed with International Policy and School of Engineering. Elements used in grading: Attendance, performance, class participation, written assignments, final paper. Cross-listed with Aeronautics & Astronautics (AA 262).",

    "courseDescr": "This year -- 2026 -- will be a fascinating backdrop for national as well as state and local politics. Implications of the current polarized electorate, the economic climate and an uneven but recovering economy, Inflation fears, wars in Ukraine and Gaza will continue to complicate the political landscape. At the apex of political interest will be the American Presidential and Congressional elections. Politics, perhaps like no other arena, provides a rich and dramatic laboratory for studying the art and science of influential communication. Whether it is a local school bond election or a Congressional race, a Presidential debate or a State of the Union Address, the demanding communications of politics provide insights into our own strengths and gaps as communicators and leaders. Political campaigns, by their very nature, are highly visible, oriented toward very specific objectives, and increasingly leverage a variety of new media platforms. They are often emotionally charged, and rife with conflict and drama. The principles foundational to political communications transcend politics, and are useful guides for leaders in business, the non-profit community, as well as government. How candidates, elected officials, and leaders in all kinds of organizations communicate vision, values, and experience, as well as how they perform in very fluid environments, not the least of which may be during a crisis, has a great deal to do with their career success. In its 16th year, this highly interactive course allows students to explore both theory and practice behind effective positioning and presentation. Students will analyze and evaluate both successful and unsuccessful communications strategies of political campaigns and candidates. History is an impactful learning tool, something emphasized throughout the class. As such, students will explore historic examples of US Presidential debates, from Nixon/Kennedy to the present, as well other political events from the near and distant past. Popular culture, the effect of social media, disinformation will also be topics of discussion. Students will experience discussion of political events as they happen -- with each class drawing lessons from political developments around the nation and the world. Students will also hone their own strategic communications skills in activities requiring both written and spoken communication. This is not a course in political science, American government, or in public speaking. However, the engaged student will gain insights into those areas as well. The course is taught by David Demarest, former Vice President of Public Affairs for Stanford University. Demarest has broad communications experience across the public and private sector in financial services, education, and government. Typically, Prof. Demarest shares many of his experiences -- some successful, some less so -- through storytelling, and while those stories may be entertaining, they also provide real-life examples of communications challenges and strategies, After serving as Assistant U.S. Trade Representative, and Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Reagan Administration, in 1988 he served as Communications Director for Vice President George H. W. Bush's successful presidential campaign. He then became a member of the White House senior staff as White House Communications Director. After leaving government in 1993, he spent the next decade leading communications for two Fortune 50 companies, before coming to Stanford in 2005 to head the university's public affairs efforts.",

We will examine how Iran transformed from a dynastic society rooted in kinship and religious authority into a modern nation-state shaped by competing ideologies, mass political movements, and global pressures. The course begins with a brief overview of premodern Iran and the historiographical traditions that have shaped its modern narratives. We then trace Iran's role as a geopolitical buffer between imperial powers, the internal tensions between tradition and modernization, and the far-reaching consequences of the Constitutional Revolution (1905¿11), which marked the beginning of Iran's twentieth-century transformation. We will study the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi (1921¿41), whose top-down modernization reshaped the state and society and created space for religious institutions and actors to emerge as sources of popular political authority. The second half of the course focuses on the rule of Mohammad Reza Shah (1941¿79), his clash with Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, the White Revolution, and the unrest that culminated in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. We conclude by examining the Islamic Republic's formation, the Iran-Iraq War, and ongoing struggles over reform, civil rights, and modernization, with particular attention to youth and women's activism. This course is not only about engaging with academic literature but also about developing the tools to navigate information in a region often labeled volatile and media-hostile.

Shortly after the discussion, Huygens, a Dutch scientist, published De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae (The Value of all Chances in Games of Fortune) in 1657; this is considered to be the first treatise on probability. Due to the inherent appeal of games of chance, probability theory soon became popular, and the subject underwent rapid development in the 18th century with contributions from mathematical giants, such as Bernoulli, de Moivre, and Laplace. There are two fairly different lines of thought associated with applications of probability: the solution of betting/gambling and the analysis of statistical data related to quantitative subjects such as mortality tables and insurance rates. In this Introsem, we will discuss poker and other games of chance, such as daily fantasy sports, from the perspective of risk analysis. This Introsem does not require any programming knowledge, but some experience with Excel, MATLAB, R, and/or Python will enhance your experience in our discussion of daily fantasy sports.

    "courseDescr": "The premise of this course is the success of a startup (and even a large company launching a new product) is most dependent on finding a market that is desperate for its product. Focusing on product/market fit conflicts with the conventional view that a startup's limited resources should be applied to perfecting the execution of day to day activities. Interestingly almost every successful product driven technology company followed a similar path to find its product/market fit, but it was usually by accident. In this course we attempt to define the consistent process each successful company pursued, which in most cases is highly counterintuitive, and how to apply it to different situations. Our class highlights the potential conflict between pursuing a conventional approach and optimizing product/market fit. In order to really bring out this conflict, we employ a seminar format with only 25 students so every issue can be evaluated in detail. Our lessons are limited to information technology-based companies, but we have been told they may be more broadly applicable. That being said, this course has been designed for someone who is truly interested in technology-based entrepreneurship. Students who choose to take this course must be committed to read all the assigned articles and books to have the proper foundation to address the frequent counterintuitive learnings. In some cases that might require an entire (although relatively short) book be read for an individual class. A written assignment addressing at least one of the learnings from each reading will be required to be submitted at least four hours prior to each class. Failure to submit even one of the written assignments will result in a U. In addition to the daily written assignments, there will be a large individual project required at the end of the course. In other words, this course requires far more commitment than a typical GSB course, especially for one that offers only two credits.

The proteostasis machinery maintains the function of destabilized and mutant proteins, assists the degradation of damaged and aggregated proteins, and monitors the health of the proteome, adjusting it in response to environmental or metabolic stresses. Most mutations linked to disease act by challenging the structure, stability or function of proteins. Thus, understanding and manipulating proteostasis could hold the key for the therapeutic treatment of a wide range of diseases. Cellular proteostasis declines during aging, leading to increased prevalence of late-onset aggregation-linked amyloid diseases implicated in many devastating neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS).

The goals of the class are to read widely in the canon of twentieth and twenty-first century queer prose literature, and to write critical and creative work that engages with the styles, modes, and subjects of these writers. As we read and discuss texts, students will consider a variety of questions: How has queer romance, relationships, and sexuality been represented over the years, in both coded and explicit ways? How have writers grappled with representing our evolving sense of gender as a continuum rather than a binary? How have queer writers interrogated or understood the concept of family? How do queer writers handle the question of the \"universal\" reader to whom, arguably, they might be speaking? (In a 2012 interview with Lambda Literary, book critic Daniel Mendelsohn argues,contentiously, \"It is precisely the gay book's ability to be interesting to a straight reader that makes it a great book.\") Lastly, students will also create writing of their own that in some way draws upon the aesthetics or sensibilities of the authors we have read. These pieces may be short stories, personal essays, or texts that--in the spirit of queerness--blur or interrogate standard demarcations of genre. The content of this work might grapple with questions of gender and sexuality, but it might instead be queer in its affect, outlook, or style.

We might ask: what does a scene make you feel? where do you feel it in your body? what makes a text come alive to you and only you at this moment in your life? Note that this is not an invitation to indulge in narcissism or narrowness in the classroom; rather, this is a chance to appreciate how subjective each person's interaction with a text is, and how valid a panoply of viewpoints.

We will consider what it meant to participate in literary culture, and how writing constituted an exercise of voice that conferred authority and status. We will also interrogate gender as a concern of literary analysis: what does it mean to write like a woman? What difference does gender make in the creation and appreciation of literary works? How do different cultural contexts shape different answers to these questions? In addition to considering gender difference, we will also examine other forms of difference, such as race, class, and nationality, and we will interrogate the fascination of gender for the conceptualization of difference. We will read works by women writing in Medieval France to contemporary Francophone West Africa and Vietnam, as well as literary works and critical essays exploring questions of gender and feminism.

Yet our societal crises, from climate change to increasing inequality to mental well-being, are deepening. This course problematizes how we have conceptualized and practiced innovation, with the objectives of reimagining what alternative approaches are possible - and desirable - and exploring how we can put them into practice. In particular, we examine what it looks like to innovate for a more sustainable and democratic future, in which human dignity is prioritized. We begin by historicizing innovation itself, interrogating how economic goals and technological solutions have become central to social betterment. For example, today, why do we default to geoengineering, rather than collectively seeking social and political means toward sustainability? We unpack assumptions about technoscience, human agency, natural resources, and the \"good society\" that are embedded in common views of innovation, and study less visible dimensions, such as maintenance and repair, care work, commodity life cycles, and the limits of expertise and standardization. Students will read from classics in social sciences to recent works in STS, engage with current issues through journalistic and cultural materials, and rethink innovation through their final research projects.",

The greatest contributions of earth system science to date have mostly documented and quantified the (many) ways that our energy and food systems are degrading the environment. Increasingly, earth system scientists are also working to evaluate the consequences of environmental changes for human wellbeing, but an exciting research frontier exists where such scientists are applying interdisciplinary methods to identify and prioritize more sustainable solutions. The course will be structured around 8 different sustainability challenges. For each, we will explore the state of interdisciplinary scientific efforts to characterize and quantify problems and key barriers (Tuesdays) as well as efforts to identify, evaluate, and deploy solutions (Thursdays) - always including cross-cutting considerations of social, political, and economic factors, interactions among the challenges, and critical-but-unresolved research questions.

We will examine how new approaches to understanding the natural world established the foundations of the modern sciences. Our protagonists will include Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Linnaeus, and plenty of less famous but equally fascinating figures. We will consider the social, global and imperial contexts of early modern science, the importance of material culture - instruments, collections, artistic productions - and the circulation of scientific ideas between laboratories, academies, courts, and the public sphere. By the end of the course, students will have learned to detect the myriad ways in which scientific ideas and practices reflect the world of their making.",

    "courseDescr": "As individuals, we would like to believe that we are free from biases and that we are somehow immune to acting on the social biases that we have been socialized to since birth. We would like to believe that we can report experiences accurately, recalling events as they truly happened. But, memory is faulty and stereotypes and social biases are pervasive. And, at a level beneath our own control, these biases slip in and influence our memory of events. Eyewitness memory, and the inaccuracy and unreliability of eyewitnesses, is a perfect example of this. But, what about the things we hear? Speech carries a great deal of information; packets of co-varying cues we have been raised to recognize categorically, informing us about a talker's race, accent, emotion, and gender. We have, through our ears, information about events that occur. And, we have in our minds, stereotyped expectations about how various groups of people behave and what various groups of people might say. In this course, we will explore how these two types of information (e.g., the percept of what is actually heard vs. our stereotypes about who is likely to have said what) clash together and influence 'earwitness memory'. We will read and critique journal articles, blogs, and popular science articles, think about the reliability of memory for auditory events, and we will work together to develop three well-designed thought experiments that address questions at the heart of this issue. Along the way, we will learn a bit about the acoustics of speech, social variation in speech, speech perception and spoken word recognition, memory, and experimental design and analysis. Students in this course should be committed to reading the assignments, sharing their ideas about the readings (without concern for 'being right'), and think creatively about ways we can explore the idea of earwitness memory together. While this is a one-quarter course, my goal is to pursue our thought experiments collaboratively, with any interested students in subsequent quarters.",

The workshop will consist of specialized sessions, most of them tailored towards the work of empirical research that occurs after the data collection phase. During the quarter the fellows are expected to submit drafts of different chapters of their thesis and present their preliminary findings in class. If appropriate, the workshop may also include group and/or individual sessions designed to address the very specific needs of the research undertaken by the SPILS Fellows.

This course will consider state and local potential in terms of mitigation (to help decarbonize our energy systems and reduce greenhouse gas emissions), including through electricity and gas provision; energy efficiency in buildings; cars, land-use planning, and transportation; and direct regulation of fossil fuel extraction. A second unit of the course will focus on infrastructure and other adaptation efforts related to escalating risks of wildfire, heat, drought, floods, and coastal land loss. A third unit focused on loss and damage will cover the aftermath of climate-related disasters, including the state and local role in decontamination, clean-up, and reconstruction, as well as in insurance and other compensation systems for managing loss of life, property destruction, economic losses, and reconstruction.

    "courseDescr": "Many students come to the GSB with the intent to pivot upon leaving the institution. Some students feel they have outgrown their position or business, or they feel drawn to a new area that better suits their values and interests, where they can make a greater contribution. Some students have no idea what they want to do after graduating, they just know they want to make a purposeful change. And finally, some students want to strategically change their direction for reputation reasons. The average U.S. employee tenure is only 4-5 years and job roles often change dramatically within that timeframe. Pivoting is an intentional, methodical process for nimbly navigating career changes. A recent Gallup study revealed that almost 90% of workers are either 'not engaged' or 'actively disengaged' from their jobs. A pivot is a change made of your own volition when you have reached a point in your career when you are ready for increased challenge and impact. Strategic Pivoting is a course specifically developed for any student who already plans to pivot in their career and wants to figure out how to successfully build and create their next chapter. In this course we will discuss four stages for how to best pivot: 1) Planting, how to assess and set a strong foundation of values, strengths and interests. 2) Scanning, researching new and related skills, talking to others, and mapping potential opportunities. 3) Piloting, students conduct small, low-risk experiments to test their new direction, as well as gather real-time data and feedback. And 4) Launching, pulling the trigger, fully committed, to your carefully plotted pivot. The ultimate pay-off to Strategic Pivoting is acknowledging and adapting to a rapidly changing society when it comes to career paths. Because our careers are so fundamentally tied to our livelihood and sense of confidence, purpose and meaning, changes can be traumatic without a road map for traversing them. \"Navigating this accelerated pace of change and this transitional career state, and learning to embrace it instead of resisting it, can become an edge and advantage.\" Alex Rodriguez, Major League Baseball icon, ABC/Fox Sports/ESPN commentator, entrepreneur, and CEO of A-Rod Corp will be a featured Guest Speaker in this course.

The main objective of the course is to give you the tools you need to understand research in the field of strategy and contribute to it.

Those who will be caregivers, and those who will need a caregiver.' Former First lady Rosalynn Carter. We have a broken care system in the United States. Americans spend more than $648 billion annually on care, and it is expected to grow. There is a significant labor shortage of trained caregivers. In 2025, 63 million American adults provided ongoing care to adults or children with a medical condition or disability - representing almost one-quarter of all adults in the United States. The infant and childcare market is similarly unaffordable, fragmented, and broken. Every business leader today is confronting the complexities of a workforce of young parents, often challenged to find care for their children and/ or their parents and family members. These markets, often referred to as the Care Economy, are overlooked and ripe for reinvention with the potential for enormous social impact. This course will expose students to key insights about the Care Economy from five perspectives: business leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, caregivers and policymakers. We will explore the spectrum of care needs from infants and children to older adults, and how other developed countries such as Singapore, Denmark, and Japan have created their care systems and addressed the needs of working families. During the course, students will meet several distinguished business and thought leaders working to build a better care system, including the CEO of a leading care navigation company, major investors in the Care Economy, and key leaders and policy innovators spearheading public-private partnerships for caregiving. The course will include cases, panels with innovators and entrepreneurs, class exercises and care workshops, and lectures. Class topics will include the ROI of care to employers; the caregiving ecosystem; the different needs and complexities of caring for infants, children, older adults, and those with disabilities; and understanding the payors.

It begins with the birth of the Democratic Party in the 1820s, slavery, and the exponential growth of the nation's population, cities, and several important industries. While the textile, railroad, coal, and steel industries are often discussed within the nation's development in the nineteenth century, the making of popular music is less understood as one of the country's major industries to emerge during this era. This course will take a historical and theoretical approach to unpack the making of the music industry through the first original form of commercial popular entertainment to emerge in the U.S.: Blackface Minstrelsy. We will explore how the aesthetic, structural, and cultural foundations of Blackface and the American popular music industry shaped the musical and political landscape of the emerging nation leading up to the pre-recording era at the turn-of-the-twentieth century. Through exploring sheet music, live performance, historical documentations of performance, early sound recordings, key musicians and composers, early music industrialists, recording technologies, and other cases, we will develop a more comprehensive understanding of how inequities are structured into the making and selling of America popular music today, particularly within: community and identity making; music and copyright law; and the complex legacy of genre-making in the commercialization of popular music.

    "courseDescr": "The field of early childhood development is undergoing a profound transformation in the 21st century. Traditional models of child development, while foundational, are increasingly challenged by the complex realities of our rapidly changing world. This course, \"The New Ecology of Early Childhood,\" is designed to equip graduate students with a comprehensive understanding of an emerging paradigm being formulated at the Stanford Center on Early Childhood (SCEC) that reconceptualizes early childhood development within the context of contemporary global challenges and opportunities. The course is built upon the premise that the ecological systems in which children develop are no longer as clearly delineated as once conceived. Forces that were previously considered distant or indirect now exert immediate and powerful influences on children's developmental trajectories. And the prevalence of some direct influences (e.g., time spent early care and education environments, residing in extended family households) is increasing. These shifts necessitate a radical rethinking of how we understand, study, and support early childhood development. By offering a comprehensive exploration of this emerging paradigm in early childhood development, this course prepares students to navigate the complex realities of supporting all children thriving in the 21st century. It challenges students to think critically, engage with cutting-edge research, and develop innovative solutions to pressing challenges. Through this course, students will not only gain a deeper understanding of the new ecology of early childhood but also develop the skills and perspectives necessary to become effective practitioners, researchers, and advocates in this rapidly evolving field.",

This course has three objectives: 1) increasing students' ability to diagnose and analyze power and politics in organizational situations; 2) enhancing students' ability to acquire and exercise power successfully; and 3) helping students come to terms with their own ambivalence toward having and using power. In short, the goal of this course is to enable you to be agentic and still remain authentic. Topics covered include: the primary sources of power, including individual attributes and structural position; dealing with resistance and conflict; obtaining allies and supporters; maintaining influence; how and why power is lost; and the use of strong communication and body language in exercising power. The class involves a large number of written, self-reflective assignments and an individual project--a personal plan for developing your own path to power.

In this creative writing course, we'll read narrative journalism, personal essays, and contemporary fiction that expand and complicate our understanding of what's at stake in the fight for reproductive justice. We will hear firsthand from activists about the writers and thinkers that shaped their work, the relationship between reading and changemaking, and the importance of amplifying new, more expansive definitions of reproductive justice. We'll consider how a craft-based approach allows us to avoid the didactic and lean into the complexity, nuance, and intimacy that the best political writing has to offer. Students will be supported in conceptualizing, executing, and revising an individual creative writing project - fiction, personal narrative, or hybrid form - that represents a thoughtful contribution to the question: What does reproductive justice mean to you? In the first half of the course, we'll be engaged mostly with the stories of others - using the reproductive justice theoretical framework to contextualize fiction, memoir, and political narrative. During this time, students will begin formulating an idea for their final creative project, and the final four weeks of the class will focus on drafting and revision. Our inquiries will focus on questions of craft and the power of narrative technique to lead us to more complex, personal, and inclusive understandings of reproductive justice.",

We first discuss political and economic theories of why and when regulation is imposed. We then explore the relationship among elected officials who enact energy policy legislation, agencies that implement these policies, courts that enforce agency decisions, and entities that are the targets of energy policies and seek to influence them. Case studies of successful and unsuccessful regulation in environmental regulation generally and in climate policy specifically are discussed.

While nature nurtures humans along with other beings, the numerous mysteries that it poses - some still unresolved - continue to destabilize politics' promise of orderliness and set limits to the emancipatory potential of social arrangements of various kinds. The endeavor to tame nature's whim and parse its inner logic - be it through science or art - proclaims to liberate us from the disillusionment with our own state of powerlessness without ever settling the tension between humans and their surroundings. The looming threat of the climate crisis and the global pandemic further reminds us of the persistent challenges brought to politics by our embeddedness in the physical world. How does the idea of nature, along with the various methods deployed to examine it, give rise to key concepts in our political thinking, including law, state, and property? What aspirations can various accounts of nature bring to politics in terms of what the latter can hope to achieve with regard to freedom, equality, and happiness? How are human beings supposed to arrange their own societies vis-à-vis their neighbors - human and nonhuman - with whom they share the earthly realm?

To do this, the class creates the conditions so students can interact as directly as possible with individuals engaging and depending on the ocean to sustain their livelihoods from a diversity of perspectives. We choose the Gulf of California in Mexico as an illustration because of its prominence as a region of high biodiversity and conservation interest, and its history with community-based sustainable development and conservation. Students must read key theoretical literature on the commons, sustainable development, community-based conservation, self-governance, small-scale fisheries, commoning, food systems, knowledge(s), indigenous peoples, and methods for collecting social science data in the field. We also read about the specifics of the local culture and natural history before traveling to the region. Once there we visit with fishers, conservation practitioners, tourism operators, marine protected area managers, indigenous people, and others. During our visits we use the newly acquired theory we have read to deconstruct and understand how local stakeholders view, practice, and govern their interactions with the ocean. This allows us to understand how and why they define community, conservation, sustainability in the ways they do, and put that back into a global perspective by asking what does this mean to the way we debate, articulate community, conservation and sustainable development? We also visit the places that are the object of these conceptualizations. We ask students to bring out their inner natural historian and explorer-selves, while experiencing first-hand the rich cultural and natural history we are immersed in. Together with an appreciation for the local politics and global pressures, students have the opportunity to question established theory, identify new questions, and gain an appreciation for field interdisciplinary data gathering methods.

It aims to identify not only how recent innovations in computational theory can provide new ways of understanding social systems as computational systems, but also how social systems can provide new ways of understanding the structure and nature of computation itself. It covers foundational discoveries in CSS to date that are grounded in well-defined mathematical and/or simulation-based models, as well as successfully validated with empirical data from experiments and observational studies. Each class is organized to examine a potential feature and/or dynamic of social systems that may (or may not, as we shall discuss) be considered a defining constitutive characteristic of uniquely social computation. The features/dynamics covered in the seminar include social network structure, social contagion and diffusion (i.e., the spread of ideas and behaviors through populations), collective intelligence and the wisdom of crowds, conventions and social norms, categories and analogies, cultural markets and path dependent historical evolution, innovation, ranking systems, and search processes, and the macro dynamics of organizations that coordinate and aggregate collective cognition and behavior. The penultimate class reviews current efforts to use large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence more generally to imitate human agents in controlled psychological tasks and simulated social network environments, with the aim of examining (i) whether these artificial agents can serve as viable models for predicting, identifying, and explaining the computational dynamics of social systems, and (ii) whether these models can be improved toward this end using the theory of social computation explored in this seminar.",

A relatively small, but highly significant portion of these individuals who drink ultimately reach criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Today, almost 15 million people in the U.S. struggle with an AUD. Many decades of research have sought to uncover the brain-based driving forces behind alcohol misuse, the consequences of alcohol on brain function and structure, and how we can effectively treat Alcohol Use Disorder. This course will first cover our current understanding of the brain circuits the drive alcohol craving, use and withdrawal. Then, we will explore alcohol¿s effects on the brain throughout the lifespan, ranging from prenatal alcohol exposure, adolescence, young adults (including binge drinking in college), middle adulthood, and aging individuals at risk for cognitive decline. Lastly, this course will cover the state-of-the-art techniques being developed to help individuals achieve sobriety and recovery from Alcohol Use Disorder. This highly interactive seminar will engage and equips students with skills in critical thinking, evaluation of scientific research, and a deeper understanding of AUD as a brain-based disease. Students will have the opportunity to engage in thoughtful discussions with treatment providers and AUD patients to gain a deeper understanding of the realities behind AUD treatment. Overall, this course is intended to help students develop strong skills in thinking and reading like a scientist, understanding the complexities behind alcohol use and misuse across the lifespan, and considering the reality of today's treatment landscape for Alcohol Use Disorder.",

Utilizing an interdisciplinary lens, it explores the complex phenomenon of gender-based violence (GBV), examining its causes, manifestations, and the political, social, and economic structures that sustain it, as well as ways to prevent and address it. The course asks how GBV, while globally widespread, manifests differently across varied contexts and has varying implications for intersecting identities across gender, religion/belief, nationality, class, disability, race, migration status, and more. Given the growing threat of Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence (TFGBV), the course also delves into how technology and online spaces can harm individuals and groups based on gender, with grave political implications, including on democracy and freedom of expression. Moving from recognition to prevention, the course integrates both theoretical analysis and applied approaches. It examines the roles of state and non-state institutions, community groups, and individuals in identifying and resisting violent structures and advancing strategies for justice and human rights. Special attention is given to policymaking, international frameworks (such as those developed by the United Nations), and transnational feminist responses across the Global South and North. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the critical tools to analyze the dynamics of gender-based violence across global contexts and to imagine transformative responses, policies, and laws.",

Each week, we read and discuss a book that challenges our understanding of work, meaning, perception, and personal agency. Through structured conversations, students connect ideas across disciplines (ranging from anthropology, to fine art, to technology), exploring the nature of creativity, purpose, and self-perception. The course is experiential: Classes have activities designed to drive discussion and put concepts into action to be evaluated, students also take on two projects - one focused on removing a challenge or constraint in their life, and another open-ended project tackling something entirely new (past projects have included writing a book, starting a business, learning a skill, or making a bold change). Take this course if you are interested in inspecting and rethinking how you approach your life and work - so you can move forward with clarity and confidence.

It was a highly experimental, sometimes radical, and deeply politically and aesthetically engaged era at the turn of the last century when, as the poet Ezra Pound exclaimed, artists had to 'make it NEW'! What 'it' was and what 'new' meant were up for grabs. Everything about art, life, living, identity, and meaning was up for renovation and remaking. Women writers were especially interested in the possibilities and problems for what it might mean to live anew, without the constraints and formalities of how culture had historically conformed gender, class, racial, and national identities for them. In this course, we will be reading a series of novels, poems, essays, and manifestoes from British and American women writers (1900-1950) that will give you a sense for how different women writers responded to the opportunities and challenges of self-expression in this era, and what resonances their writings continue to have in our own times. Some writers may include: Virginia Woolf, Rebecca West, Jean Rhys, Djuna Barnes, Jessie Fauset, Zora Neale Hurston, Katherine Mansfield, Marianne Moore, Elizabeth Bishop, and Gwendolyn Brooks.",

The course places these writings in conversation with broader ideas from literary criticism and spatial theory. Alongside textual sources, we engage with visual and material culture including painting, photography, and architecture, to trace how women's visibility and mobility were represented and regulated.
