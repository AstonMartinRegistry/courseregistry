    "courseDescr": "The Roman Empire not only united the Mediterranean basin and much of Europe politically but also precipitated an unprecedented (and hardly since repeated) process of linguistic, cultural, and economic integration and convergence within this region. This process has often been discussed by modern scholars of antiquity under the heading of 'Romanization.' In recent decades, simple models of the displacement of indigenous traditions by 'Roman' cultural norms have been thoroughly critiqued and nuanced, but debate remains regarding the extent and intensiveness of cultural homogenization and integration within the empire as well as the mechanisms by which this occurred. Ultimately, we must interrogate the very nature of this process (e.g., as assimilative or syncretic, coercive or collaborative) as well as what it meant to the inhabitants of the empire to be Roman as well as what Roman-ness (Romanitas) means to us in the modern world. To this end, the course will explore a number of discrete but interrelated topics including linguistic transformations, diffusion of religious traditions, popular culture, the spread of urbanism, Roman citizenship, the adoption of Roman law, human migration and mobility, political and economic integration, as well as ethnic and political identities within the Roman Empire from the 1st century BCE to the 5th Century CE.",

    "courseDescr": "Although easy to lose sight of in the midst of the Coronvirus epidemic, the United States is in the midst of an opioid addiction epidemic. More than 10 million Americans 12 years and older are estimated to have misused opioids in 2018, most of which misuse was linked to prescription drugs. Approximately 47,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in that year. Opioid use is reported to have peaked in 2011 but opioid addiction remains a problem in many parts of the country (CNN Editorial Research, \"Opioid Crisis Fast Facts,\" June 21, 2020, available at https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/18/health/opioid-crisis-fast-facts/index.html). The opioid crisis presents a variety of public policy challenges. Like the Crack epidemic of the 1980s, opioid misuse has had disproportionate effects on certain communities. While the former disproportionately affected poor Black urban communities and other urban communities of color, the latter has primarily affected poor White communities, particularly in non-coastal areas of the country. The former was met with popular criticism of its victims and draconian criminal justice policies that incarcerated a generation of Black Americans and other people of color. The latter has been met with an outpouring of concerned media commentary, and funding (however insufficient) for public treatment programs. It is difficult not to conclude that systemic engrained racism explains much of this difference. The opioid crisis also differs from the crack crisis, however, in that opioid victims and their advocates have been able to target responsible parties and attempt to hold them accountable for the harm and losses their conduct has imposed on addicts, their families and their communities. It is widely agreed that the origin of the epidemic was the virtually unlimited distribution of prescription opioid drugs, allegedly encouraged by the drug manufacturers and enabled by other corporations in the pharmaceutical supply chain and by the physicians who prescribed the drugs. The opioid epidemic has also led to a wide-ranging litigation, which has taken as its role model earlier litigation against tobacco manufacturers and ongoing litigation against gun manufacturers. The opioid litigation stands as an example of joining private and public civil litigation to claim compensation for losses due to alleged wrongdoing by private corporations and in the process reshape public policy with regard to harm. To prevail against defendants, plaintiffs have had to persuade courts to apply liability doctrine in unusual although not entirely new ways. Much of the litigation resulting from opioid overdoses and addiction has been contested in the federal courts, which have deployed an armamentarium of formal and informal procedural rules and practices developed over the past several decades to manage and resolve large-scale litigation. Innovative approaches have been adopted by the federal judge assigned to manage the litigation. Key defendants have chosen to manage their liability by seeking the protection of the bankruptcy courts.

This course prepares future leaders to guide, govern, and operationalize artificial intelligence with the purpose of engaging in key \"real world\" challenges and approaches to address derisking, shaping, governing, and enabling AI leadership in the private sector. Focus is geared not towards the deep technologist or the privacy/IP/regulatory specialist, but on the future general counsel and/or business leader who is interested in studying real world business issues in the rapidly changing landscape of AI. With an interdisciplinary approach, we will consider business, strategic, operational, financial, governance, and other emerging issues. The class format will involve practical case studies and projects and will include guest speakers, AI practitioners, and thought leaders from business, technology, law, and governance. The goal is to equip future lawyers to act as essential strategic leaders in enabling the effective, responsible, and beneficial use of AI into the future.

Instruments considered include criminal sanctions, administrative regulations, tort litigation, taxation, and public and private insurance and compensation systems. Students will evaluate these instruments across multiple dimensions, including effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, benefit-cost tradeoffs, unintended consequences, political feasibility, legitimacy, and competing conceptions of justice (distributive, procedural, and retributive). Policy instruments will be compared not only to each other, but also to two baseline alternatives: doing nothing (allowing problems to resolve through individual or market action) and relying on private sector solutions. Whereas many SLS courses examine particular instruments in depth, this course emphasizes broader analytic frameworks for comparing policy approaches across domains. Although relevant theories and normative perspectives will be discussed, students will focus on evaluating how these instruments function in practice--whether they achieve their intended goals in specific contexts.

    "courseDescr": "Addressing climate displacement is one of the central sustainability challenges facing current and future generations. The climate crisis is already driving people to move. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, approximately 31.8 million people around the world were displaced by floods, storms, fires, and other weather-related hazards in 2022 alone. Coastal communities in the U.S. and beyond are already in the process of planning relocation to escape erosion, rising sea levels, and other slow-onset effects of climate change. Displacement has significant economic, social, psychological, and cultural costs. Yet persistent knowledge gaps on these costs and how to mitigate them impede the efforts of leaders, advocates, and policymakers who face climate displacement challenges today. Join us for a one-unit seminar as we explore how to make sense of the human impacts of climate change on individuals, communities, and governments - and, in particular, on the ways in which the climate crisis is already forcing people to move or reconfigure their communities. Joined by a series of guest speakers who bring personal, policy, and scholarly expertise to this emerging issue, this seminar will speak to the phenomena of both internal and cross-border migration driven by climate change. The seminar will focus on both understanding the challenges that come with the climate crisis as well as proposed solutions to these challenges and opportunities for correcting past injustices and harms. Possible thematic focuses for our discussions include: (1) Legal, policy and governance implications of internal versus cross-border displacement, (2) The nexus of climate with conflict/public health/agriculture as drivers of migration, (3) Individual- vs. community-centric displacement solutions (e.g., household buyouts vs. community planned relocations), and (4) Indigenous sovereignty and rights in context of climate-related migration.",

The relationships of violence specialists to states can be cooperative or ambivalent as well as antagonistic¿or networks of these men can make up the state itself. The political challenge of violent men who are embedded in the rest of society - at once of it and outsiders to it - will always be with us.

What happens when states cooperate with these groups, suppress them, or attempt to use them? And why are these groups so startlingly like one another, within many different polities and during many different times? This course will analyze political interactions in terms of contested negotiations around male interpersonal violence. It will explore these negotiations through groups of what Charles Tilly called \"violence specialists:\" soldiers, the police, thugs, criminals, etc. In many times and places, these men were and are a \"labor pool\" of violence who offer security and muscle; and who also turn to criminal activity. The relationships of violence specialists to states can be cooperative or ambivalent as well as antagonistic¿or networks of these men can make up the state itself. The political challenge of violent men who are embedded in the rest of society - at once of it and outsiders to it - will always be with us.

In the Winter quarter it will meet three hours per week. In the Spring quarter, it will meet ONLY FOR SIX WEEKS for four hours per week--for 3 units of course credit. During those six weeks, the course will meet on Tuesday and Thursday. Exactly which five weeks the course will meet will be announced during the Winter quarter. This will involve scheduling with outside guests, but I will make every effort to schedule those six weeks for the first half of the quarter. Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters. All of the first quarter will be spent in a traditional classroom setting but with untraditional materials. Much of the course material will consist of case studies of business transactions (and no case law). We will use those case studies to analyze the economics underlying a wide range of business transactions and the contractual terms and structures used to respond to underlying economic challenges. During the second quarter, we will explore deals in greater detail by studying five complex transactions in full. For this part of the course, students will be divided into groups and will be assigned one of the five deals. Each group will give a presentation of its deal to the class, and in the following class, a lawyer, banker or other participant in the deal will come to class to present the deal based on his or her experience. We study five new deals each year. Deals we have studied over the years have included movie financings, biotech alliances, venture capital financings, cross-border joint ventures, private equity investments, corporate reorganizations, and more.

    "courseDescr": "Deep disagreement pervades our democracy, from arguments over issues ranging from policies dealing with Covid to gender-affirming care, to the regulation of protests, to the President¿s authority to fire members of federal agencies. Loud voices drown out discussion. Open-mindedness, humility, and critical thinking seem in short supply among politicians, citizens, and other residents alike. Yet constructive disagreement is an essential feature of a democratic society. This class explores and models respectful, civil disagreement. Each week features scholars who disagree- sometimes quite strongly- about major policy issues. Students will have the opportunity to probe those disagreements, understand why they persist, and improve their own understanding of facts and values that underlie them. The course may be taken for one or two units. The basic, one-unit class is open to all Stanford students, with other members of the Stanford community welcome to audit individual classes. The requirements are to do the readings in advance of each class, attend, and listen attentively and critically. Because the topics are different, students who took the course in 2024-25 may enroll this year as well. A limited number of undergraduates may take a second unit of credit. Students enrolled in the two-unit course will participate in weekly small group discussion seminars about the topics discussed by the guest presenters in the course that week. The discussion seminars will be led by peer facilitators, with the goal of developing critical thinking skills and discourse skills, such as active listening and curiosity. The peer facilitators are undergraduate students who have completed training in dialogue facilitation. Each discussion seminar will have a maximum of 10 students.

We will explore practical approaches to the following questions: How can we make ethical decision-making accessible to ordinary citizens in a complex world of technology, biology and even space exploration? How can we incentivize citizens to care about integrating ethics into their decision-making? How do we each have ethical power in society even where economic and technological control lie with tech giants and lodged in the brains of experts? What, if anything, is different about citizens' sense of moral responsibility in society today (and how has technology contributed to shifting views)? How can we develop an ethics barometer soliciting the views, and facilitating the influence of, ordinary citizens on key ethical questions outside of normal channels like voting and individual engagement with social media?

We will begin in the nineteenth century with the \"March of Intellect\" cartoons and the first steam-powered fantasies of progress. We will consider how factories, railways, and telegraphs helped construct modern states and new kinds of citizens. From there, we will trace how everything from Cold War cybernetics and Soviet centralization to Silicon Valley libertarianism recoded political life through algorithms and data. Throughout the course we will ask: what kinds of knowledge count as expertise? Who decides how a system should function and for whom? Technology will be treated as a central force in shaping what modernity is and what has been promised. We will explore how ideas of rationality, control, futurity, and innovation have been embedded in everything from computer systems to climate models. At the same time, we will examine the cultural and emotional dimensions of technological change, in particular its illusions, enchantments, and unintended consequences. This is a course about the politics of machines, but also about the humans that dream them into being.

    "courseDescr": "This course is designed for students interested in a unique look at entrepreneurship, early-stage investing, and venture capital. The venture capital ecosystem is going through a dramatic cycle as US venture capital investment dropped from a record high of over $350B in 2021 to less than half that level ($165B) in 2023. We then witnessed a slight recovery of VC investment to $215B in 2024. As we navigate through tariffs, inflation and an uncertain economy in 2025 and 2026, venture capitalists are likely to retain the power at the negotiating table. The notable exception is for a select number of seed stage entrepreneurs and AI related investments where entrepreneurs have an advantage. Many investors and entrepreneurs look at this chaotic environment as a time to return to safe harbors by reducing risk. We suggest a more adventurous strategy. Our course offers alternatives to what many advisors consider `best practices'. Our goal is to improve your ability to create or invest in a breakthrough idea. Many of these concepts come from the course textbook, Pattern Breakers, by Mike Maples, Jr and Peter Ziebelman. The course is designed to give you the tactical tools to proactively and confidently navigate this chaotic environment. You will hear from over 15 investors and half dozen entrepreneurs. Students have enjoyed our differentiating speaker format -- instead of just one guest speaker, we invite two speakers for many of the class sessions. Our two-speaker technique allows for an unscripted discussion about the class topic or case. The course is designed to complement other popular GSB courses about entrepreneurship such as Startup Garage, Formation of New Ventures, and Lean Launchpad. Our course gives you that tactical edge with a special combination of two class projects, guest speakers and case-based instruction. You will be able to apply what you learn as we (and the guest speakers) offer candid and instant feedback. The course is fast paced with very current content. Notably, students are permitted to use the same business idea in our course's team project that they use for a different course (with instructor permission). If you do not have a business idea or market sector interest, we will team you with another student with similar interests. We offer class topics that are typically not covered in other business school courses - such as how to find and use the power of early stage advisors and board members in building and funding a company, how to find that ideal co-founder and figure out the equity split amongst the founding team, and what do VCs say behind closed doors at the VC's partners' meeting after the founder gives their funding pitch? The course attracts students from diverse backgrounds (we intentionally reserve 10 seats for graduate students from outside the GSB).

    "courseDescr": "This course will explore changing notions of truth in a world in which technology, global risks, and societal developments are blurring the boundaries of humanity and boring through traditional notions of nation states, institutions, and human identity. We will ask one over-arching question: Does truth matter anymore? If so, why and how? If not, why not? Either way, how does truth relate to ethical decision-making by individuals and institutions and to an ethical society? How does truth relate to a life well lived? Six themes will organize our exploration of more specific topics: science and subjectivity; identity; memory; AI; spirituality and religion; imagination; and truth and a life well-lived. Examples of topics to be explored include, among others: truth and AI/Gen AI; DNA testing, crypto, and other technologies; University challenges today (free speech, DEI, and beyond); gender and racial identity; social media \"truth modifiers.\" The course will offer a parallel journey in exploring your personal views on truth and truth and a life well-lived. We will consider how we determine and verify the truth; how we \"do\" truth; the role of truth in ethical decision-making; the importance of truth to effective ethical policy; and the relationship of the truth to a life well lived.
