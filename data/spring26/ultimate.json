    "courseTitle": "Surviving Space",
    "courseDescr": "Space is dangerous. Anything we put into orbit has to survive the intense forces experienced during launch, extreme temperature changes, impacts by cosmic rays and energetic protons and electrons, as well as hits by human-made orbital debris and meteoroids. If we venture beyond Earth's sphere of influence, we must also then endure the extreme plasma environment without the protection of our magnetic field. With all of these potential hazards, it is remarkable that our space program has experienced so few catastrophic failures. In this seminar, students will learn how engineers design and test spacecraft to ensure survivability in this harsh space environment. We will explore three different space environment scenarios, including a small satellite that must survive in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), a large spacecraft headed to rendezvous with an asteroid, and a human spaceflight mission to Mars.",

At its best, practitioners in this field expand the conceptual terrain for what it means to fully engage the human experience of illness. Course participants will learn how people - who are also gendered, raced, aged, classed, and frequently \"othered\" -  differentially manifest conditions in various global settings. By chronicling and questioning established norms and modes of communication around health and disease, students in this course will do close readings of how anthropologists relay people's narratives about what it means to be sick, or afflicted, in different parts of the world. Working from a global view throughout the course, yet with close ethnographic detail in weekly readings, students will be invited to examine whether or not biological phenomena can be thought of as strictly \"natural.\" Lectures and discussion sections will invite reflections on how it is that medical anthropologists convey people's illness experiences within the contexts of anthropologists' larger fieldwork projects, which can include research with experts and medical institutions. Course participants will also examine the tensions between \"the universal\" and \"the particular\" as we explore how specific conditions, ranging from genetic disorders to infectious disease, reproductive technologies, hormonal health, gendered suffering, and climate grief (to name a few) articulate with the body within larger political contexts, or \"body politics,\" worldwide. Lastly we will be attentive to how cultural articulations of disease expose the priorities and anxieties of the social worlds in which bodies become afflicted in the first place.",

Topics include: the shifting burden and social meanings of disease; how sickness has impacted individuals' sense of citizenship, religion, identity, and the law; the impact of epidemics/pandemics on the size and shape of government and empire; the economics of the medical profession, hospitals, insurance, and biotech industries; the history of race, gender, and the body; the changing doctor patient-relationship; how mass-casualty events like war create cultural shifts; the politics of immunity and vaccination; and why illness and death is so hard to write about evocatively. The 200-series \"Doing History\" requirement offers students an intellectual bridge between Sources & Methods courses and 209S. Treating a specific subfield within history as the focal point, these courses will explore how each subfield emerged, how it engages with allied fields outside of History, and how it has changed over time. Students will gain deep familiarity with the primary theoretical frameworks deployed by scholars working in this area as well as the intellectual impetus these scholars articulate to legitimize their inquiries. In learning more about the inner workings, or \"backstage,\" of the discipline students will gain insight into how to ask historical questions and shape historical problems.

    "courseDescr": "The class begins with the art, architecture and political ideals of Periclean Athens, from the emergence of the city as the political and cultural center of Greece in 450 to its defeat in the Peloponnesian War in 404. It then considers how the Athenians (shell-shocked from war and three outbreaks of plague) and the rest of 4th century Greece rebuild their lives and the monuments that define them.  Earlier 5th century traditions endure, with subtle changes, in the work of sculptors such as Kephisodotos.  Less subtle are the outlook and output of his son Praxiteles. In collaboration with Phryne, his muse and mistress, Praxiteles challenged the canons and constraints of the past with the first female nude in the history of Greek sculpture. His gender-bending gods and men were equally audacious, their shiny surfaces reflecting Plato's discussion of Eros and androgyny. Scopas was also a man of his time, but pursued different interests. Drawn to the interior lives of men and woman, his tormented Trojan War heroes and victims are still scarred by memories of the Peloponnesian War, and a world away from the serene faces of the Parthenon. His Maenad, who has left this world for another, belongs to the same years as Euripides' Bacchae and, at the same time, anticipates the torsion and turbulence of Bernini and the Italian Baroque.  The history and visual culture of these years remind us that we are not alone, that the Greeks grappled as we do with the inevitability and consequences of war, disease and inner daemons.",

While the emphasis of this course is on developing fluency in reading and analyzing the Latin texts, you will have opportunities to discuss and research the biographical, political, and literary issues raised by the readings. A primary focus of your inquiry will be the connection between art and propaganda as you examine how Vergil either contributes to or subverts the vision of Rome's imperial destiny and civilizing mission. In addition you will read the remainder of Books 7-12 in English and become familiar with the general outline of the first half of Vergil's epic. Your knowledge of the content and syntax of the readings will be assessed by several short quizzes. You will also sit for mid-quarter and end-quarter tests. Each of you will give a brief presentation on a topic relating to the life or poetry of Vergil, the historical background of his era or his influence on literature, art or music.

Some of these questions concern the metaphysical status of literary characters and indeed works of literature themselves, some concern our cognitive engagement with literature, and some concern classic philosophical topics like good and evil, free will and responsibility, faith and doubt, and irrationality, self-harm, and the search for fulfillment. We will approach these questions by reading works of contemporary philosophy alongside Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov. This pairing will allow us to appreciate what is gained - and what is lost - when philosophical ideas are presented in works of fiction rather than in discursive prose. Throughout the course, we will engage the Socratic method of learning through guided questioning and shared inquiry, analyzing philosophical arguments as they emerge within narrative form.

The archaeological imagination is a creative capacity mobilized when we experience traces and vestiges of the past, when we gather, classify, conserve and restore, when we work with such remains to deliver stories, reconstructions, accounts, explanations, or whatever. This class will explore such a wide archaeological perspective in novels, poetry, fantasy literature, the arts, movies, online gaming, and through some key debates in contemporary archaeology about human origins, the spread of urban life, the rise and fall of ancient empires.",

From video games, forum posts, memes, and streaming TV or movies, to the short-form video of TikTok, Youtube, and Instagram, this class will trace the complicated relationship between the past - or rather, our ideas about it - and our view of the present.

It deals both with competing visions of what democracy might be and their actual realization around the world. A major element of the course is to consider different conceptual approaches to democracy-direct, representative, participatory, and deliberative. How do different political systems borrow from these concepts to enhance or justify their forms of governance? How are they evolving or reforming in ways that may address the current crisis of democracy and renew public faith in the efficacy and worth of democracy? Democratic institutions are subject to a living dialogue, and we intend to engage the students in these debates, at the levels of both democratic theory and ongoing democratic practice and institutional designs. In the second half of the course, we will examine innovations like Deliberative Polling and institutional reforms of electoral systems and accountability structures that could increase civic participation, reduce polarization, rein in corruption, and improve the functioning and legitimacy of democracy.",

Technology has helped create utopian visions of good society while plunging societies into dystopic nightmares. Science and technology have been a universal path for all societies to join the modern world, but different cultures think about them differently. The Enlightenment ofthe West conceives scientific modernity as emancipation from religion and superstition and as a power over nature. In contrast, the traditional Chinese worldviews incorporate technology into a sacred cosmos where humans use science and technology to stay in tune with Heaven and Earth. Today, technoscience discourse has become a dominant power and ideology. Technoscientific agendas are generating class disparity,eroding the social fabric, undermining the humanist traditions, and damaging nature and climate. Science fiction thinks about how science and technology transform human society, values, and everyday experiences in ways good or bad. By projecting both utopia and dystopia, sf reveals and critiques technology-induced social malaises and keeps hopes alive by projecting better futures, testifying to the ceaseless human potential for self-renewal in sustaining civilization on Earth. This course asks the two-fold question: How can humans of diverse cultures harness technoscientific innovations while preserving humanist values and maintain a sustainable economy and civilization? How do narratives of utopia and dystopia depict the anthropocentric domination of nature and the exploitation working classes through themisuse and abuse of technology?

Neurotechnologies have generated hopes of providing improved prosthetics or treatment for people with neurological and mental health disorders. However, as these biotechnologies are developed and implemented, they raise important questions regarding justice and equity. Who benefits from these advances in science and technology, and who is excluded?

In this course, students will both become proficient with practical tools and develop a deeper, intuitive understanding of the involved software systems and computer science concepts. With this deeper understanding, students can leverage critical thinking skills to intelligently and efficiently configure and troubleshoot software systems, assess the security and efficiency of particular tool usages, and synthesize new automation pipelines that integrate multiple tools. To summarize, instead of having just a cursory understanding of how to use these tools, students will learn how to most effectively use these tools to become proficient programmers and computer scientists. In addition, this course can provide a gentle introduction to potentially challenging computer science concepts (e.g., networking) that become a focus in subsequent courses and also help motivate some of the tool usages they will see later in the degree program.",

The class is arranged topically around current issues, and burning questions that rest at the heart of the study of sustainability and ecology such as how to navigate crises, sustain community, repair and restore the planet, learn from the more-than-human world, and imagine just futures for all. Each week we explore how different cultural, artistic, and spiritual disciplines and practices have attempted to answer these burning questions -  doing so with our eyes trained upon complex, real-world problems. Students of any background seeking an introduction to, and focus on, the study of sustainability from various humanistic perspectives will find a home in this course. Material created in this class can be used as a potential capstone project.",

    "courseDescr": "Books that promise their audience the key to a better life have always had undoubtable mass-market appeal, as have fictional texts with less overt yet no less moralizing themes. Since the late Middle Ages, various iterations of what is broadly known as \"conduct literature\" have perennially proved some of the most popular content among readers and consumers. This course will explore the development of this phenomenon, tracing our collective taste for media that models \"the good life\" (whether in moral, social, or material terms) from some of the earliest Middle English instructive poems, to Victorian etiquette guides, to mid-twentieth-century magazine columns, to modern-day influencer content. Interweaving explicitly instructional works with selections from poetry and fiction, we will ask: How do we define \"conduct literature\", and what makes it unique as a genre? What do readers seek within these texts, and what are they offered in return? What can the historical prevalence of this genre tell us about our own culture's reading habits? And do texts of this nature play into traditional patterns of conformity and control? As we explore such questions about literary and cultural values across time, we will also hone our skills in critical reading and research writing.

We will have occasion to consider texts that primarily deploy characters as embodiments of concepts or ideals, and will think critically, too, of historical movements that have formed our taste for literary figures of flesh and blood. A focus on the implied people of texts requires a reckoning with social categories and ethical distinctions more generally. We will thus read throughout with an eye toward the literary and sociopolitical structures that make it possible to perpetuate - if not to realize - the fantasy of knowing others \"by the content of their character.\" Students will visit the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco on Friday, April 24 at 8:00 pm to view a stage production of Hamnet (adapted from Maggie O'Farrell's novel by Lolita Chakrabarti, dir.

To contemplate this, we will sort of retrace the footsteps of image as it was thought of by writers of times different than ours. Was an image ever a \"quiet\" thing or did its conjuring in words always disrupt the conscious in some way - either awakening it or dulling it. Remember the images that books put into your heads when they were read to you. Were you surprised by them, contented by them - do they linger still for you when you summon them. Readings this term are meant to build our conceptions of what an image was, is, and can be. Early filmmakers will also guide us up to the gate of the now. This is all backdrop scenery for conversations we will have in class, followed by in-class writing time, followed by readings and discussions of your work. Let us not even call it work. It is play, of a kind that allows us to put words into the air and let them invoke and evoke. But we will take our play seriously and in good company, creating an imaginarium by supporting and encouraging one another. This is a safe realm where images may be conjured, studied, discussed, revised, abandoned, reclaimed, celebrated and enjoyed for the distraction they allow us as well as the truth or fiction that made them.

    "courseDescr": "What does it mean to be human if thinking and reasoning can be done by a machine? The advent and proliferation of generative AI tools raises a host of profound and unsettling questions. While some herald the AI revolution and its promise to liberate us from mental drudgery, others prophecy doom and oppression. While the technology might be new, the anxiety and ambivalence are not. From Socrates, who worried that the technology of writing would \"implant forgetfulness in the learners' soul,\" to Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer who quipped, \"machinery mutilates people today, even if it also feeds them,\" writers and thinkers across place and time have looked on with horror and awe, hope and despair, as technology has transformed the way we live, work, and gain knowledge of our world. In this intellectual history seminar, we will read classic texts that have engaged with questions related to technological innovation and taken stock of both its promise and peril. Readings include work by Plato, Martin Heidegger, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Hannah Arendt, Rachel Carson, Herbert Marcuse, Michel Foucault, Alan Turing, and Donna Haraway. Alongside these texts we will consider some of the historical developments and themes that motivated these authors: industrialization, the mechanization of warfare, nuclear destruction, the space age, the rise of consumer culture, environmental degradation, the spread of surveillance technologies, and reproductive freedom. Through reading, discussing, and working out complex ideas together, this class will give us a deeper vocabulary and conceptual framework for thinking through the current moment.",

Problems that may arise by labeling conditions that vary in incidence, prevalence and/or severity across the \"male-female\" spectrum as \"men's\" or \"women's\" health issues will be discussed.

Beginning with the politicized practices of second wave feminists up through contemporary trends in memoir and autofiction, we will confront an array of intersectional autobiographies that connect personal experience to broader movements, power structures, and oppressions. How has life-writing contributed to the articulation of feminist consciousness? How has feminism impacted the methods marginalized authors use to create forms for belonging and self-determination? As we think about the politics of life-writing, we will also consider feminist rhetorical and aesthetic strategies for confronting issues like trauma, disability, incarceration, motherhood, and friendship. Each student will conduct a large-scale research project focused on an author, genre, or theme of their choice. As we research the critical historical contexts for feminist memoir, we will simultaneously conduct our own creative experiments in life-writing.",

Feminist scholars have long studied the gendered and racialized dynamics of work, such as the impact of migration flows on the global care industry and the feminization of housework and \"service with a smile.\" Rapid technological change has created new forms of labor in the content moderation industry, the gig economy, transnational surrogacy, online sex work, and automation and AI?all sites where shifting notions of work and the worker challenge existing frameworks around immigration and legal status, national borders, and workers' rights.

By integrating cinema from the postcolonies of both India and Pakistan, this 1-2 unit course intends to examine how the onus of marginality in the Global South has now shifted from the oppressed to the oppressor: the emergence of social media and technocracy has \"bestowed\" the subaltern with a platform to speak. The more pressing question is: is anybody listening? By integrating weekly screenings with lectures from Stanford faculty and seminar-style discussions initiated by the course director, this class will confront apathy as a postcolonial pandemic, thereby inciting discourse around its horrors - and the enmity that perpetuates them - through the case studies of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. The course will open with an introduction to Bollywood song-and-dance and the foundations of subaltern theory, before moving across transhistorical case studies that examine post-Nehruvian cinema of the '60s, the representation of Pakistani social lives on Indian television, and the emergence of epistemological violence in post-2014 Hindi cinema, among other themes. By the end of this course, students will have a consolidated understanding of the role marginality has played in the cinematic, corporeal, and affective histories of postcolonial cinema. They will also be able to trace the origins of bigotry as it manifests in contemporary Hindi cinema, as well as examine the role dissenting filmmakers have played in politically subverting mainstream Hindutva narratives. This holistic outlook seeks to engage the course's central question by confronting apathy and interrogating the possibilities for resisting it. Course Instructor: Shiven Jain",

In this course we look at works that turn the lens inward and offer a self-examination of one's own culture or the land that the makers belong to. This inversion of gaze is the fulcrum of this course. We work through the convergence of thinking and practice as filmmaking process, with an emphasis on how to work with sound to create portraits. For final projects, students work in groups to make 3-5 minute video portraits of individuals or communities of their choice, exploring in the work itself the place of the personal and the place they are looking from.",

The bridge between conceptualization and practicality is in translation of ideas to practice. There are several historic examples of close ties between translation and innovation in US history and in the industrial world.  Translation is closely associated both with innovation and disruption. The class intends to address specific challenges including the following. The businesses on their path to innovation are strongly rate-limited by the translation problems of new ideas.  Many of the inventions often do not make it into the market place or are disrupted at multiple levels in ways that are generally unpredictable. The class intends to provide an understanding how disruptive innovations take place in the context of the larger frame of translation and a framework for traversing this difficult path.  In addition to class lectures, practitioners who have been involved in the process of translation in the real world will be invited to share their experiences.",

What are you (a material object?, an immaterial soul?), and what kinds of changes can you undergo without ceasing to exist? Is the idea of someone traveling through time to the distant past or far future somehow incoherent? In virtue of what are some propositions necessarily true or necessarily false, whereas others are merely contingently true or contingently false? Throughout the sciences certain propositions are described as laws of nature, but what makes a proposition a law of nature? Is the existence of free will compatible with the results of our best scientific theories (which purport to show that our world is governed by deterministic laws of nature)? Finally, can all facts be explained? What about facts like that our universe is conducive to life, or that there is something rather than nothing? Our focus throughout will be on contemporary work.

Taking account of perspectives from historical linguistics, political theory, law, sociology, and quantitative social science, this course examines a number of questions about language in the life of a political society: How does a language emerge to spread across a political society? Why do some go on to expand regionally and even globally while others shrink and decline? How does the presence of multiple languages in a political society affect communal relations and institutional development? How can we model and test theories of language dynamics?

    "courseDescr": "Social cognition - the ability to infer and represent the unobservable contents of others' minds - is a critical component of what makes us human. What are the basic elements of social cognition, and what do infants and young children understand about others' actions, thoughts, and feelings? How do these capacities help them learn about the world as they interact with others in the first few years of life? This course will take a deeper look at the theoretical perspectives and scientific findings at the intersection of social cognition and cognitive development. Students will read 3 - 4 journal articles each week (reviews and empirical papers), on themes ranging from attribution of agency and mental-state reasoning to communication, moral judgment, and prosocial behaviors. In this course, students will be encouraged to think hard about the fundamental questions about the human mind and how it interacts with others, and the value of studying infants and young children to address these questions. Students should expect to read, present, and discuss theoretical and empirical research articles, and write a research proposal as a final project. This course is designed for upper-level undergraduate students who already have a basic understanding of cognitive development (PSYCH60 is required). This course fulfills the WIM requirement.",

Today, great power competition is back, with many analysts describing our current era as a \"New Cold War\" among the United States, China, and Russia. How did we go from the euphoria surrounding democracy, globalization, and the West three decades ago to the current uncertainty about democracy and the liberal international order and the rise of illiberal great powers? Is the Cold War label an illuminating or distorting analogy, and how stable or enduring is this current moment of global confrontation? The course seeks to answer these questions and analyze contemporary great power relations more broadly. We will (1) review major theories that explain relations between great powers; (2) trace the historical origins of the U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relationships; (3) assess the similarities and differences between the Cold War and U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations today along three dimensions - power, ideology, and interdependence and multilateralism - and (4) discuss unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral policy prescriptions for how U.S. leaders can meet the challenge of great power competition in the 21st century.

The works we will read - by Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu), Emily Dickenson, James Baldwin, William James, Du Fu (Tu Fu), and others - are not intended to be representative of traditions, of eras, or of disciplines. They do, however, present a range of viewpoints and of styles that will help frame and re-frame our views on the good life, and they will illustrate and question the role that great texts can play in a modern 'art of living.' Perhaps most important, they will develop and reward the skills of careful reading, attentive listening, and thoughtful discussion.

In this course, we will probe into these various facets of our lives today through a critical reflection on the ways we live today (and the ways we talk about life today). But we will also do so by considering how other societies, ancient and foreign (or just hidden in plain sight), have lived (and talked about life) in ways that challenge our very conception of what life entails. All of this will be facilitated through an eclectic array of activities: watching films together, reading poetry and novels, field trips (to an LSD museum or a scent shop), philosophical discussions, and collective writings/vlogging and self-examination. The purpose of this course, in short, is to introduce students to the life of the humanities--or, at the very least, what that life could be.

This course examines the history of Yoga's practice and philosophy in its many cultural and religious contexts in light of the most recent scholarship on the subject. We will challenge common misconceptions regarding Yoga, such as the notion that the Yoga postures we practice today are thousands of years old, that Yoga is intrinsically Hindu, or that Patanjali's Yoga Sutra is the fundamental text of Hatha Yoga. We will survey the different roles that Yoga has played in most of the religious traditions of India, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sufism or Islamic mysticism. We will pay specific attention to the diverse systems of thought and practice philosophies, psychologies, and \"meditational\" disciplines - that Yoga has upheld throughout its history. We will also see how Yoga traveled from India to the West in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, how it has changed over time, and how it has become the global phenomenon it is today. Seeing the complex plurality of what Yoga has been and can be, we will further ask what the limits of Yoga are: is \"Beer yoga\" or \"Goat yoga\" really Yoga? And what is the future of Yoga? This class combines lectures with discussions. The readings include accessible secondary literature and a selection of primary sources.

Despite the frequently euphoric tenor of \"global\" discourses in the art world, which tend to celebrate more than critically assess a new era of interconnectedness, it is possible to trace global art history back to the late 19th century, when the world became linked in unprecedented ways through commerce and empire, and when modernist practices emerged outside the West in dialogue with parallel movements in Europe. Global histories of modernism require attending to the circulation of artworks and expressive forms across cultures, regions, political and religious ideologies, and time periods. Noting how objects and practices traveled between East and West, North and South, rural and urban areas, colonies and metropolitan centers - that is, across a spatially and culturally diffuse modernity, accompanied by inevitable time lags and interpretive discordances - this seminar deals with the theories, methods, and narratives of global modern art history, exploring a range of thorny issues. We will especially consider different ways of researching and constructing arguments about global modernisms in relation to complex historical phenomena - including the Cold War, decolonization, and globalization - whose power dynamics have often been difficult to decipher.",

This course explores how Iranian writers, architects, and filmmakers of the early 20th century reflected socio-political change incumbent in the age of transition from tradition to modernity and modernism. We go beyond the traditional binaries of Orient and Occident, global or local and seek to explore cultural shifts as much to understand their global influences as their roots in inherited forms and narratives. Students read fiction, poetry, essays, and journalism, and study films and visual archives, while analyzing architecture as a built space, as it is represented in literature and depicted in cinema. Architecture mediated between past and present and underwent transformation itself. By comparing these different forms of discursive practice, we try to explore how words, images, spaces, and movement changed, and how they reveal Iran's complicated relationship with modernism and tradition. All materials are available in both Persian and English.",

Past years' classes have given students access to executives from Apple, Munich Reinsurance, Bank of the West, Silicon Valley Bank and Wells Fargo, the community of Paradise California, pioneering small-to-medium sized businesses founded by diverse trailblazers, and professional and student athletes seeking to manage personal finance and wealth. We've found that the language of design allows us to discuss the rarely discussed challenges of finance, its impacts on families and how to shift the narrative for the better in the current and future generations.",

The course material deals with both the transformation of existing organizations to succeed by being more sustainable, and with 'ecopreneurship' - the creation of a new organization aimed at successfully advancing environmental sustainability. The course is built on two very different bodies of research, one dealing with success and the other dealing with sustainability: Regarding success. The course draws on the extensive literature in strategic management and entrepreneurship. This work gives us specific, actionable lessons that you can use when creating and scaling your organization. These lessons increase the chances that your efforts will lead to an organization that spectacularly changes the world. Students interested in generating comfortable, incremental change should not take this course. Those interested in creative destruction - overturning the status quo with radical, innovative transformation - should take the course. Regarding sustainability. The course is informed by the experiences we are seeing among changemakers all over the world, as they tackle humanity's great sustainability problems. These include climate change and the energy transformation, of course, but more broadly also include a wide variety of other issues: biodiversity loss and regeneration, waste and the circular economy, food security and our need for water, human conflict and displacement, environmental justice, our oceans, preservation and conservation, and adaptation and resilience, among other topics. And the organizational forms we consider will also be varied. We will study companies that seek to make money in the capitalist economy by competing on the basis of environmental sustainability. But we will also be looking at non-governmental organizations, social movement organizations, public-sector organizations, and organizations involved in health and education as they also play a central role in the transformation of our economy and society to be more sustainable.

    "courseDescr": "Historically, piezoelectric materials (e.g., PZT and Quartz) have been the backbone of many electroacoustic technologies, spanning from sonar and phonographs to signal filters for TV/radio and gas igniters. Some of these technologies have been subjected to constant improvements and miniaturization throughout the decades, but their dependency of bulk piezoelectric materials to operate has impaired their integration with electronics. The adoption of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) manufacturing methods together with the advent of sputtering-based piezoelectric materials (e.g., AlN) has transformed the field of piezoelectric sensors and resonators to the point that now all these technologies can be mass manufactured and packaged in small form-factor chips. In this course, you will learn the basics behind the design, fabrication, characterization, and packaging of piezoelectric MEMS, as well as their most successful commercial applications in the areas of sensing, RF, and power management. We will review the fundamentals of elasticity that will be recurrently used throughout the course. To determine the sensitivity of piezoelectric transducers, we will derive the Euler-Bernoulli and Sophie-German equations that respectively determine elasticity in flexural beams and plates, including the effect of residual film stress. Regarding dynamic analysis, we will dive into the mathematical tools needed to compute the effective mass and natural resonance frequency of vibrating rectangular slabs (e.g., Rayleigh's energy method) and uncover the main damping mechanisms that limit their Q factor. The piezoelectric effect will be the transduction mechanism of focus, so you will learn relevant material science concepts associated with it, such as piezoelectric stiffening and electromechanical coupling. As examples of piezoelectric MEMS sensors, this course will cover piezoelectric MEMS microphones, Quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) and piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducers (PMUTs). In RF, the holy grail of piezoelectric MEMS is bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators with its different flavors: film bulk acoustic resonators (FBAR) and solidly mounted resonators (SMR). We will learn their linear and nonlinear modeling circuit techniques and how they can be arranged with electronics to form filters and oscillators. Finally, we will explore two emerging areas of development in power management using piezoelectric MEMS: piezoelectric energy harvesters and piezoelectric DC-DC converters, which are key to supply energy to low and high power systems, respectively. All this knowledge will be complemented with Finite Element Modeling (FEM) using COMSOL Multiphysics and put in practice in real MEMS technology applications",

A central focus of the course is the body as a site of crisis, resistance, and renewal. Through engagement with performance works that foreground physical suffering and the limits of embodiment - such as those by Florentina Holzinger or Marina Abramovic - students examine whether posthumanism truly transcends human vulnerability and historical trauma. Assignments include analytical essays, reflective writing, and practical theatre rehearsals that enable students to explore philosophical concepts through embodied expression. This integrated approach encourages both critical and creative responses to the shifting boundaries of human identity in German cultural production, showing how theatre and the arts reflect - and challenge - broader social, political, and philosophical transformations.",

    "courseTitle": "The Converso Condition",
    "courseDescr": "This course focuses on the problem of religious conversion in Spain prior to 1492, its expression in writing, and in the cultural representation of human subjects as they become protagonists of consciousness. Spanish cultural history has tended to assume that conversos formed a homogeneous, resistant group. Traditional historiography offers a vision of conversos that is structured fundamentally around binary oppositions and articulated along cultural and religious fault lines. In this model the exercise of power in society tends to manifest itself only as a repressive or resistant force as it underscores gestures and attitudes that are either imposed upon conversos or prohibited for them by institutionalized forms of authority (i.e., estatutos de pureza de sangre, allegations of Judaizing, censorship, Inquisition, etc.). The result is that conversos are portrayed as persistently threatened, marginalized subjects living under the specter of ostracism, shame, or abjection. This course will challenge the binary understanding of conversos, especially in the period during the second half of the 15th C leading up to the Expulsion (1492) when the images of the Jew and the converso become more problematical than previously imagined and are marked by fluidity and ambiguities that fail to denote discrete borders of identity constructed by society. To do this, we will examine 5 converso authors and one nuclear family of them (Mosen Diego de Valera, Fernando del Pulgar, Teresa de Cartagena, Antón de Montoro, and Juan de Lucena, the printer, and his six daughters) who successfully negotiated the corridors of power, legitimacy, and prestige in Castile during the period leading up to 1492, and whose \"converso condition\" proved socially and politically advantageous.",

How do the \"rules of war\" apply in non-traditional, asymmetric conflicts between states and nonstate groups? 4. How are just war and law of armed conflict principles reflected in other cultures? 5. To what extent does international law reflect just war theory? How and when do they deviate from one another? 6. What are the main critical challenges to traditional just war theory and the legal regime governing the use of force? Students will write research papers in this class addressing how ethical and legal norms regarding war operate in such contexts as in government decision-making, in legal debates regarding the interpretation of the law, on the battlefield, and in courts and tribunals.

These famous leaders will come from a variety of fields including academia, government, law, public service, public health, the military or journalism. We will then hold small group discussions after the interviews to debate the decisions made by these leaders. Through discourse and deep reflection we aim to prepare students for their own leadership challenges of the future.

In general, such fears and fantasies stem not from encounters with actual Jews, but rather from anxieties prompted by the spectral, shapeshifting, fictive figures of \"the Jew\" and \"Judaism\" - that is, the images of Jews and Judaism as constructed by outside observers. But why did such myths and stereotypes emerge at all? How did these become so widely accepted? What made them so persuasive and so powerful? Did they inspire violence, or merely legitimize it? This seminar will explore key moments in the development of antisemitism from ancient Egypt to the Enlightenment, including the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the emergence of an association between Jews and moneylending, the appearance of the blood libel, and early manifestations of racial hostility.",

Understanding beautiful theory, without the ability to apply it, is essentially useless. Conversely, creating state-of-the-art spreadsheets that apply incorrect theory is a waste of time. Here, we try to explicitly combine theory and application. The course will be divided into 6 modules, or topics. The first day of each module will be a lecture on an investment topic. Also provided is a team modeling project on the topic. The second day of each module will be a lab. The lab day will begin with modeling concepts (tips) designed to help you use Excel to implement the module's investment topic. After the tips are provided, the remainder of the lab day is devoted to teams working on their modeling project and allowing for Q&A. On the third day of each module will be presentations and wrap-up.",

    "courseDescr": "This is a course to help future business leaders understand the policy risks that result from the changing relationship between the United States and China. Driven in part by policy decisions over the past decade in Washington and Beijing, the world built by the West after World War II is changing. Most American policymakers now label the relationship between the U.S. and China as one of strategic competition. They are often less clear on whether this term applies to the governments, the peoples, the businesses based within each country, or the two nation-states. At the same time, these two superpowers also have shared interests. We seek to understand the changing relationships between the U.S. and China, and what both competition and possible cooperation between their governments mean for others. American business leaders may be caught between two governments with conflicting interests. Business leaders in other countries may be caught among three governments: America, China, and their home-country government. This is a course not about China per se, but instead about the interactions between these two superpowers' governments and policies. We will look at the U.S.-China relationship by unpacking and examining distinct elements, devoting 1 or 2 class sessions on each topic. Relying in part on guests with practical expertise in some element of the U.S.-China relationship, our goals are to understand:* The most significant changes in Chinese policy direction in the Xi era;* Changes among Western leaders' policy approaches as they have realized their 50-year-old policy toward China either was wrong or is now out-of-date;* What the strategic competition label might mean and how it could translate into specific policy changes in both countries;* What opportunities exist for cooperation and mutual benefit despite strategic competition;* How China might try to change the post-WWII international rules and organizations;* How leaders of global businesses, in the U.S., China, and other countries, are caught between these two governments;* What decoupling in certain industries might mean; and* Possible ways to think about these issues as the U.S.-China relationship evolves.",

Through representative examples, including optimal targeting, dynamic learning and stochastic resource allocation, this class examines how various modeling approaches inform data collection, system analysis and ultimately, optimal decision making. Emphasis will be placed on synthesizing generalizable best practices for stochastic modeling in dynamic and/or data-intensive applications.",

Disagreements, often violent, dramatically shape the challenges and opportunities that leaders face, whether it be while managing diverse organizations to addressing the future of the planet. So what can we do about it? In this course, participants will consider a series of decision-making challenges that leaders of organizations have faced in societies divided by political polarization and conflict. We will combine historical and contemporary examples drawn from countries around the world at critical moments of conflict or institutional change, along with insights distilled from the newest social science research on how to address these issues. This includes work conducted by us at the Stanford Conflict and Polarization Lab. By the end of the course, participants will develop a new set of tools for identifying when, where and how they can be effective leaders  in societies divided by political polarization and conflict.",

The course material deals with both the transformation of existing organizations to succeed by being more sustainable, and with 'ecopreneurship' - the creation of a new organization aimed at successfully advancing environmental sustainability. The course is built on two very different bodies of research, one dealing with success and the other dealing with sustainability: Regarding success. The course draws on the extensive literature in strategic management and entrepreneurship. This work gives us specific, actionable lessons that you can use when creating and scaling your organization. These lessons increase the chances that your efforts will lead to an organization that spectacularly changes the world. Students interested in generating comfortable, incremental change should not take this course. Those interested in creative destruction - overturning the status quo with radical, innovative transformation - should take the course. Regarding sustainability. The course is informed by the experiences we are seeing among changemakers all over the world, as they tackle humanity's great sustainability problems. These include climate change and the energy transformation, of course, but more broadly also include a wide variety of other issues: biodiversity loss and regeneration, waste and the circular economy, food security and our need for water, human conflict and displacement, environmental justice, our oceans, preservation and conservation, and adaptation and resilience, among other topics. And the organizational forms we consider will also be varied. We will study companies that seek to make money in the capitalist economy by competing on the basis of environmental sustainability. But we will also be looking at non-governmental organizations, social movement organizations, public-sector organizations, and organizations involved in health and education as they also play a central role in the transformation of our economy and society to be more sustainable.",

The concept of translation can be cast as the following equation, which will be discussed in the class: Innovation = (Inventiona+ C) × Translationb (Where a, b, and C are greater than zero) In light of these challenges, this class will address the following strategic questions and use it to propose a framework for innovation that will increase the probability of successful translation. The class will attempt to address the following questions and extract the principles for enabling translation. 1. What is Translation and why is it necessary? (Examples of Translation from the instructors and visiting lecturers) 2. What does it take for Translation that connects concepts to reality to succeed? 3. What factors prevent Translation from succeeding? 4. What general theoretical framework can we construct to encompass the various types of disruptive innovation?",

    "courseDescr": "The premise of this course is the success of a startup (and even a large company launching a new product) is most dependent on finding a market that is desperate for its product. Focusing on product/market fit conflicts with the conventional view that a startup's limited resources should be applied to perfecting the execution of day to day activities. Interestingly almost every successful product driven technology company followed a similar path to find its product/market fit, but it was usually by accident. In this course we attempt to define the consistent process each successful company pursued, which in most cases is highly counterintuitive, and how to apply it to different situations. Our class highlights the potential conflict between pursuing a conventional approach and optimizing product/market fit.  In order to really bring out this conflict, we employ a seminar format with only 25 students so every issue can be evaluated in detail. Our lessons are limited to information technology-based companies, but we have been told they may be more broadly applicable.  That being said, this course has been designed for someone who is truly interested in technology-based entrepreneurship.  Students who choose to take this course must be committed to read all the assigned articles and books to have the proper foundation to address the frequent counterintuitive learnings. In some cases that might require an entire (although relatively short) book be read for an individual class. A written assignment addressing at least one of the learnings from each reading will be required to be submitted at least four hours prior to each class. Failure to submit even one of the written assignments will result in a U. In addition to the daily written assignments, there will be a large individual project required at the end of the course. In other words, this course requires far more commitment than a typical GSB course, especially for one that offers only two credits.  However I promise this course will be invaluable should you choose an operating or investment career in the technology business.",

Some biologists estimate that 35% of animals and plants could become extinct in the wild by 2050 due to global climate change. Climate change is having a profound effect on ecosystem and species distribution and sustainability up and down the west coast. The effects are not uniform, nor are they completely projectable. But, they are expected to be long-lasting, and in many instances functionally irreversible. Federal and state governments are not well prepared for these challenges and may lack the policy and legal tools needed to coordinate efforts for effective interventions. Agencies may lack data necessary to identify and evaluate policy needs and goals for managing the impacts of climate change. Their ability to consider and address these impacts has been limited by both a lack of information and the dispersal of relevant programs across agencies at the federal and state levels. In many instances, statutory and regulatory frameworks are not well designed to address dynamic climate change challenges. This course will focus on analyzing these challenges and potential future policies and actions. The course will principally address possible actions in the western states and British Columbia, particularly in relation to terrestrial species. Students will learn about the structure and programs of federal and state authorities that have the capacity to address ecosystem and species impacts of climate change. Research teams will evaluate possible innovations in law and regulations, organizations and institutions, and technology and information systems.

Moreover, for reasons we will discuss in this seminar, the rules are conventionally presented as neutral, notwithstanding the fact that they determine who gets access to court, for what types of claims, and with what sorts of potential outcomes. In fact, the civil procedure rules have huge distributional consequences: some sorts of claims and claimants are advantaged and some are disadvantaged by them. Not surprisingly, then, the rule drafting process is dominated by interest group politics and in recent decades, key U.S. Supreme Court decisions interpreting civil procedure rules have been shaped by the justices' ideological preferences. At the same time, the procedural rules affect the efficiency of the litigation process: how fast disputes are resolved and at what cost, which are important to litigants on both sides of the v. Hence, there are non-ideological as well as ideological rationales for certain rules and rule interpretations.  In this seminar, we will consider the distributional consequences of the rules that shape the key stages of the civil litigation process, focusing on the pretrial stage at which most civil disputes are resolved. We will read key rules, selected court decisions interpreting their application, and commentary on interpretation (some empirically grounded), focusing on political economy perspectives. Where source materials exist, we will discuss interest group lobbying for and against rule changes and who won and lost these interest group competitions. I also hope to have a few guest speakers who have been \"on the ground\" as these efforts took place join us to share their observations.  Our topics will include the composition of and appointment to the Civil Rules Advisory Committee, pleading rules, enforcement of mandatory pre-dispute arbitration contract clauses, discovery, summary judgment, class action certification and settlement approval, and third-party litigation financing.  During the quarter, students will choose 2 - 3 topics from our syllabus and write brief (6-8 page) reflection papers considering their anticipated distributional consequences and efficiency arguments for those rules, referring inter alia to syllabus materials on relevant interest group efforts and empirical research (if any). Students taking the seminar for 2 credits will write 2 papers; students taking the seminar for 3 credits will write 3 papers, but all students will attend all seminar sessions. Papers must be submitted on the FRIDAY of the week before the session at which your chosen topic is discussed. Each student will also lead ONE discussion session on a topic of their choice. Depending on the number of students, these sessions may be led by one or several students collaboratively.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignments.",

    "courseDescr": "This interdisciplinary course integrates the legal, scientific, and policy dimensions of how we characterize and manage resource use and allocation along the California coast. We will use this geographic setting as the vehicle for exploring more generally how agencies, legislatures, and courts resolve resource-use conflicts and the role that scientific information and uncertainty play in the process. Our focus will be on the land-sea interface as we explore contemporary coastal land-use and marine resource decision-making, including coastal pollution, public health, ecosystem management; public access; private development; local community and state infrastructure; natural systems and significant threats; resource extraction; and conservation, mitigation and restoration. Students will learn the fundamental physics, chemistry, and biology of the coastal zone, tools for exploring data collected in the coastal ocean, and the institutional framework that shapes public and private decisions affecting coastal resources. There will be 3 to 4 written assignments addressing policy and science issues during the quarter, as well as a take-home final assignment.

It prevents companies like AT&T, Comcast, or T-Mobile that connect you to the internet from blocking, slowing down, or speeding up specific sites and apps, or from charging websites for access to their subscribers. Through readings, discussions, and guest speakers, this class explores current net neutrality controversies in the U.S. and around the world. We will discuss questions such as:  1. Your video is grainy even though you have a 5G plan. Is the network congested, or is your internet provider slowing video to push you toward a pricier plan? 2. Some plans let you stream Spotify without using your data, but your favorite podcast still counts against your cap. Is this helping people on tight budgets, or is your internet provider picking winners? Does it matter whether this happens in São Paulo or in San Francisco? 3. Your Netflix keeps buffering. League of Legends lags. Your internet provider blames Netflix and Riot Games. They claim the internet provider is deliberately creating bottlenecks to squeeze money out of them. Who is right? 4. 5G networks can slice internet traffic into fast lanes and slow lanes. Who should decide which apps get prioritized? Internet providers, the apps themselves, or you? You'll analyze competing arguments and develop your own position on whether and how these issues should be regulated. Open to law students and students from other departments.

Questions we will address include the following: 1. What kinds of security threats or humanitarian dangers justify recourse to war?  2. Do states comply with the law of war, and if so, why?   3. How do the \"rules of war\" apply in non-traditional, asymmetric conflicts between states and nonstate groups?  4. How are just war and law of armed conflict principles reflected in other cultures?  5. To what extent does international law reflect just war theory? How and when do they deviate from one another? 6. What are the main critical challenges to traditional just war theory and the legal regime governing the use of force?  Students will write research papers in this class addressing how ethical and legal norms regarding war operate in such contexts as in government decision-making, in legal debates regarding the interpretation of the law, on the battlefield, and in courts and tribunals.

Finally, we will cover orbital maneuvers, their planning and execution, so if you want to go to multiple places, you will know when to change course, how much time it will take to get to your destination and how much it would cost. In each lecture, we will start with theory, and then proceed with applications supported by numerical examples in Python/Jupyter notebooks. During this class, we will be accumulating numerical examples that can be used together to solve progressively more complex problems in orbital and attitude dynamics.",

Issues to be discussed will include questions of definition and nomenclature.  What is a diaspora and what are its essential features? What are the differences between victim diasporas, labor diasporas, trade diasporas, and ethno-political diasporas?  What is the relationship between place and belonging, between territory and memory? How have the experiences of migration and dislocation challenged the modern assumption that the nation-state should be the limit of identification? What effect has the emergence of new communications media had upon the coherence of cultural and political boundaries? How do these questions relate to ideas about cosmopolitanism and its relation to ethical universalism? All of these questions and many more form the subject matter of Global Black Diaspora Studies. The second part of this introductory course will continue to examine the historical and contemporary movements of peoples and the complex issues of identity and experience to which these processes give rise, as well as the creative possibilities that flow from movement and being moved.This course will meet in Building 80.",

Our study of these dance disciplines will inform the movement vocabulary, technical training, class discussions, and choreography we experience in this course. Students will learn more about the dances and rhythms for the Orishas of Brazil and Cuba, and the Loa of Haiti. Dance combinations will consist of dynamic movement patterns that condition the body for strength, flexibility, endurance, musicality and coordination. Through this approach to our warm ups and class choreography, we will deepen our analysis and understanding of how African diaspora movement traditions are inherently embedded in many expressions of the broadly termed form known as contemporary modern dance.",

    "courseDescr": "This interdisciplinary course examines the strange and strained relationship between art and empathy. Cultivating empathy is often invoked as a worthwhile moral purpose for engaging art, literature, and the humanities in general. This course explores (and explodes) this assumption while studying the history of empathy as both a moral and aesthetic concept as it evolves appears from the Enlightenment period to the current moment. How do artworks and literature enhance our understanding of empathy or activate our suspicions of it as a moral idea? How does empathy as an aesthetic concept that theorizes how bodily experiences can be projected onto others help us rethink new modes of belonging and more critical modes of reflecting? This course engages texts from across various disciplines such as art history, literary criticism, medical humanities, dance criticism and philosophy to analyze how ideas circulating around the term \"empathy\" have generated questions concerning the nature of healing, learning/teaching, and political mobilizing. We will think about these various theoretical ideas by placing them in conversation with literature and art that emerged from writers and artists from the Black diaspora. As a moral and political idea, empathy has been stridently critiqued by various theorists in Black Studies as a moral shortcut that undercuts political engagement. We will think about how these disparate ideas and critiques of empathy can open conversations onto the ways art and literature activate our embodied, cognitive, and affective participation with the objects we share together.",

    "courseTitle": "Copyright, IP, and AI in Popular Music",
    "courseDescr": "To understand the ethical, commercial, aesthetic dimensions of AI in music and copyright law today, we must consider the history of copyright law and popular music in the United States. Music copyright law was established in 1831 when sheet music became protected under federal law. During this time (the antebellum period and the exponential growth of slavery), blackface minstrelsy emerged as the first commercial form of American popular music in both live performance and through sheet music publications. Because blackface minstrelsy was founded upon the exploitation and negation of Black people primarily enslaved in America, they themselves may have either been considered property or had limited recourse to claim property for themselves. Music copyright law and property laws in general have continued to develop out of this context, though this history is often left out of litigation. In this course will revisit the history of copyright law from the inaugural Copyright Act of 1790 through the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (1988). In doing so we will interrogate the function and form of music copyright law today, while also considering ethical and economic questions around how the technologies that facilitate (e.g., phonograph recordings and artificial intelligence) and aesthetics that make up popular music are protected (or not) under copyright law (and why).

We'll read work by athletes, critics, and cultural commentators from the twentieth century to today, with a focus on how identity, performance, and power shape the stories we tell about sports. Our central theme will be the interplay of personal experience and cultural critique: how writers blend memory, observation, and analysis to reflect on athletic life. The course welcomes students from a range of backgrounds: athletes reflecting on their lived experience, fans exploring their emotional connection to sports, and readers drawn to its broader cultural meaning. Together, we'll explore how these perspectives can and do speak to one another, as well as how the conversation has evolved alongside innovations in media and genre. Our goal is to foster a classroom where storytelling and critical thinking inform and challenge each other. Alongside weekly readings and discussion, students will write short responses that experiment with both creative and analytical forms. Workshopping will be a part of the course, and the final project may be a critical essay, personal narrative, or hybrid work. No prior experience in sports or sports writing is necessary, just a willingness to think, read, and write with care. Readings will include excerpts from critical texts and athlete memoirs, as well as pieces from The Year's Best Sports Writing, as well as selections from The Player's Tribune, The Athletic, The New Yorker, The Ringer, and other platforms.

We also have to consider how everyone else was represented: women and people with non-normative genders; working people and bodies in pain; soldiers, gladiators, enemies of Rome.  In this class, we study Roman portraits from Republican verism through imperial images to changes with the rise of Christianity, practicing close looking and discussing larger issues.  What is a portrait, anyway?  How did Roman artists create likeness - and why?  Why were some portraits violently attacked?  What concepts of the person and society were at stake?  We will see how this tradition still shapes our world, from Confederate statues to selfies.",

This process is much less toxic that the traditional etching with nitric (which produces toxic fumes) or ferric acid (difficult to clean). These techniques will be complemented by other ones that can be mixed with etching such as photocopy transfers, Chine collé (attaching a different color paper between plate and main paper), and mono-printing. Etching/Intaglio (making a mark under the surface of the plate) is one of the most tactile and elegant forms of printmaking. The plate leaves a 3-D line mark and embossed marks in the deep etched areas as well as at the edges of the plate. Many major artists have left memorable images by working in this medium (Rembrandt, Goya, Kathe Kollwitz, Eduard Munch, and many others) influencing many contemporary artists.",

The framework highlights the balance that needs to be achieved by an organization across three dimensions of sustainability-related performance - environmental stewardship, social impact, and value creation - and provides a powerful lens for both evaluating the firm's current activities and designing a business strategy with sustainability at the core of its value proposition. The first half of the course focuses on developing skills to use financial statement disclosures, sustainability-related reports, and other publicly available and private sources of information to critically evaluate a company's economic performance and financial condition (i.e., the value creation dimension of the Triple Bottom line) and to measure and assess how a company's operations interacts with the environment and society (i.e., the environmental stewardship and social responsibility dimensions of the Triple Bottom Line). The second half of the course will focus on applying the Triple Bottom Line analyses to specific decision contexts, and will examine the measurement issues, trade-offs, and implementation challenges associated with identifying and executing a sustainability-oriented business strategy. The course is structured to develop students' ability to critically assess the sustainability-related performance of an organization and to ultimately translate that understanding into specific recommendations to improve that company along each dimension of sustainability. The perspective taken is that of an executive relying on available financial and non-financial information for performance evaluation, investment analyses, and strategic decision making purposes, yet the concepts and tools can also be applied by investors who need to understand whether or not the organization's activities are sustainable. The capstone to the course is the completion of a comprehensive, real-time analysis of a publicly-traded company using the Triple Bottom Line framework and the development of a set of recommendations for how the organization can improve its sustainability-related performance.",

Is this merely another phase in the modern organization's evolution, is this a paradigmatic redefinition of its structure and function, or is this a cataclysmic moment heralding the end of organizations as the central building blocks of economic activity? We will (speculatively) discuss these issues from a broad perspective, investigating how AI is already impacting work and organizational structures, as well as these changes' broader social implications (such as their effect on work/life balance, the gendered division of labor in the household, and the structure of community).

This immersive seminar combines extensive hands-on data analytics with a first-hand peek into Stanford athletics. Class meetings roughly alternate between: (1) instruction in a variety of tools and techniques for analyzing and visualizing data; and (2) guest lectures by Stanford athletics coaches explaining how data is or could be used in their sport. Through regular problem sets, students bring each week's tools to bear on data related to the week's sport. One goal of the class is empowering students to perform compelling data analytics by mastering tools across a wide spectrum, including spreadsheets, the Tableau system for data preparation and visualization, Jupyter notebooks, relational databases and SQL, Python and many of its data-specific packages including Pandas, and machine learning. On the sports side, while the Stanford coaches may touch on many aspects of data collection and analysis, the main focus of this course is on using data for strategic decision-making rather than optimizing individual human performance. Prerequisites: No background in statistics or data analysis is needed, but basic programming and computing skills at the level of high school computer science or CS106A is expected.

In considering the possible implications for education, ChatGPT has sparked dreams of automated personal tutors, customizable teaching assistance, AI-led collaborative learning, and revolutions in assessment. In addition to optimistic projections, there are clear and significant risks. For example, will AI-assisted learning be culturally appropriate and equally available to all? Can it increase opportunity for underprivileged learners worldwide, or will it accentuate privilege and privileged views?  Will it help us learn faster, or distract us from thinking deeply about difficult problems ourselves?

In this course, we explore what drives progress, what determines who gets to benefit from it, and what we can do to promote broadly shared progress. We trace the tension between progress and inequality from forager societies to Artificial Intelligence, using tools from economic history, applied microeconomics, and data analysis. Students read frontier research and popular writing. They will work with historical and contemporary datasets. The centerpiece is a storytelling project: using AI tools, you will build an interactive visual essay that brings one aspect of progress to life for a broad audience. You pick the topic.

This seminar serves as an introduction to the field of game studies by exploring the history of video games, their influence on our culture, and their status as works of art. As the anti-video game Senate Hearings in the 1990s and the \"video games cause violence\" debates in the early 2000s show, video games have been demonized as a degenerate, dangerous art form, and this reputation has not been entirely unearned, given the significant overlap between gamer culture and online harassment. We will also, however, explore how video games can serve as liberatory, intentional works of art that transcend the exclusionary behavior often associated with the \"gamer\" identity. Through our readings in the interdisciplinary field of video game studies and our play with games themselves, we will pay special attention to how games are informed by larger cultural questions around politics, identity, race, gender, sexuality, and capitalism. This course will ask you to play critically and approach these video game texts with the same rigor you would approach a work of literature.

We will analyze the recurring ideas in this body of thought such as decline, civilization, rationality, ijtihad (Islamic independent reasoning), shura (deliberative decision-making), democracy, secularism, Muslim unity, khilafah (caliphate and vicegerency), freedom, equality, and justice.

The title of the course, borrowed from a book by Michael Sandel, is 'Liberalism and its Critics' because the questions we discuss in this class center on the meaning of, and alternatives to, the liberal ideas that the basic goal of society should be the protection of individual rights and that some form of an egalitarian democracy is the best way to achieve this goal. The course is structured around two historical phenomena: one the one hand, liberal answers to these key questions have at times seemed politically and socially triumphant, but on the other hand, this ascendency has always been challenged and contested.

Nowadays, not only are ethical dilemmas harder to solve, but often, we find it difficult even just to identify or articulate the problem. In situations like this, philosophy can sometimes help us make better sense of the world. In this course, we will draw on insights from both traditional and emerging moral theories to tackle some messy nuanced moral problems that plague our digital age. The course is organized in units. In each unit, we will take an in-depth look at familiar concepts such as the good life, autonomy and equality. Then, we will learn how these concepts can inform our understanding of novel issues that spring up in our day-to-day lives. For example, we will grapple with questions such as: Do gamified apps subtly undermine our pursuit of a good life? Are social media recommender systems silently chipping away at our autonomy? Despite significant efforts towards gender equality, why is digital misogyny escalating so rapidly? The purpose of this course is not to offer you the 'right answer' to any of these questions. Instead, what you will learn is how to critically analyze ethical problems, and to develop skills that can help you better understand the complicated world around us.",

First evolving in Detroit's economic decline during the 1980s, techno is a defining beat of our time, reflecting contemporary themes of technology, urban life, resilience, and escapism through its futuristic, repetitive, and hypnotic rhythms that resonate globally - with Berlin, Germany as its perceived center of gravity. In recognition of the scene's distinctive contribution to the reunified city's cultural identity Berlin techno recently earned UNESCO recognition in Germany as intangible cultural heritage. The instant dissemination of local music via the internet, along with the advent of cheap intra-European flights, helped to spread the Berlin sound, drawing crowds who want to experience the music in its indigenous storied club setting that very weekend, thus manifesting the city's status as the recognized world capital of techno. Berlin techno has a history that is inextricably tied to the political, social and cultural climate of the Cold War period, the Fall of the Berlin Wall and the chaotic aftermath.

We will use specific examples from cities around the world to illustrate the concepts that we learn in class. The course is intended primarily for freshmen and sophomores.",

It has inspired revolutions and unifications, justified wars, fueled exclusions, and animated art, literature, and music. This course explores nationalism as an idea, ideology, and lived experience across two centuries, asking: What makes a nation, and who belongs? Must nations always become states? How have myths, monuments, gender, and religion shaped national identity? What happens when nationalism turns violent or when it is reimagined as liberation? The course unfolds in three acts. Act I: 'Imagining Nations' traces the revolutionary and romantic origins of nationalism in nineteenth-century Europe. Act II: 'Institutionalizing Nations' examines how nationalism was embedded in schools, armies, religion, and memory, and how exclusions of race, antisemitism, and gender defined its boundaries. Act III: 'Nations Unbound' confronts the crises and reinventions of nationalism in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, from fascism and Soviet nation-making to anti-colonial liberation and globalization. We will read classic theorists, novels and poetry, and engage with films and art. With a mix of discussion, analysis, and creative assignments - including the chance to \"invent your own nation\" - this course offers a journey through the drama of modern nationalism.",

But how do we account for the ways that art and ideas move across cultures? What can studying art from one place tell us about that place - and about our own places and times, which might be far away? Historically the movement of art has revealed global power structures, as well as local interests, agency, and rootedness. Globalization is commonly equated with contemporary multinational corporations, from Apple to Amazon to AliExpress, but earlier periods of global exchange have also materially shaped what art is and can be. Art can reflect and reveal a global movement of peoples and ideas, as well as the raw materials that make art possible - whether words, woods, animals, minerals, or melodies. What else does art carry with it when it moves? And how does art that is rooted in place tell us more about that place and the wider world at the same time?

Or are they merely ways to temporarily escape a harsher reality?  Are they training exercises for success in real life?  And if they don't matter, why are we so drawn to them?  According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 15-24-year-olds spend an average of 90 mins/day playing video games.  That's a lot of time! We want to give this important class of human activities the philosophical attention it deserves.  We'll examine some central questions in the philosophy of games such as:  Why play games? What even is a game?  Is there anything that all games have in common? Wittgenstein famously claimed that this is a question with no good answer - we'll see if we can do better! In addition, we'll look at some broader philosophical issues that can be illuminated by thinking about games. These include: What makes something valuable?  What are the origins of communication? How do our ethical frameworks translate to virtual worlds?",

In class discussions, we will consider questions such as: How do our early experiences in relationships affect the ones we create later? Why are we more likely to segregate and point fingers when we are afraid? How can we make better use of our precious capacity for attention? What good might come from anger, sadness or guilt? Projects will include looking at how the psychological phenomena we will learn about play out in public spheres and personal ones. This is not a class about mental health, but rather about the intricacy of our feeling and thinking minds. The course will be discussion-based with a focus on experiential learning, and include weekly projects that will have you playing detective in your own life. Prerequisites include a high degree of honesty (or the desire for this), creativity and an interest in the human experience.

Goals include: (1) building familiarity with relevant neuroscience, psychology, and economics concepts; (2) increasing awareness of key relevant literature; and (3) preparation to conduct and advance innovative interdisciplinary research.",

What's more, central branches of philosophy such as epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and political theory were transformed in the modern period amidst debates over the credibility of religious belief - primarily Christian theism - in a world come of age.

    "courseDescr": "Machine learning has led to tremendous progress in domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Fueled by these advances, machine-learning approaches are now being explored to develop intelligent physical systems that can operate reliably in unpredictable environments. These include not only robotic systems such as autonomous cars and drones but also large-scale transportation and energy systems. However, learning techniques widely used today are extremely data-hungry and lack the necessary mathematical framework to provide guarantees of correctness, causing safety concerns as data-driven physical systems are integrated into our society. This course covers the mathematical foundations of dynamical system safety analysis and modern algorithmic approaches for autonomous decision-making in safety-critical contexts. The focus is on designing safe controllers in the presence of system and environment uncertainty. The course will start with an overview of background material from relevant subfields: control theory and robotics. This will be followed by advanced techniques (reachability analysis, Lyapunov and barrier functions, etc.) in this area. The course will conclude with an overview of recent work in ensuring and updating safety guarantees while learning. Project work as part of the course will provide a flavor of research in this new emerging area.

    "courseDescr": "Freshwater is our most crucial natural resource, but it is facing mounting pressures from climate change and other factors.  While public agencies traditionally dominated water management, private water companies are playing an increasingly important (and sometime controversial) role. In many cases, private companies are making critical contributions to meeting societal water needs (e.g., by developing new technologies and finding new ways to reduce water use).  In other cases, however, the involvement of private companies has proven controversial (e.g., when private companies have taken over public water supply systems in developing countries such as Bolivia). This course will look at established and emerging businesses in the water sector and the legal, economic, and social issues generated by the private sector's involvement. These businesses include water technology companies (e.g., companies commercializing new desalination or water recycling technologies), venture capitalists, water funds (that directly buy and sell water rights), consulting firms, innovative agricultural companies, and large corporations (that increasingly are adopting corporate stewardship programs).  The course will begin with two weeks of introduction to water and the private water sector.  After that, each class will focus on a different water company. Company executives will attend each class session and discuss their business with the class. In most classes, we will examine (1) the viability and efficacy of the company's business plan, (2) the legal and/or social issues arising from the business' work, and (3) how the business might contribute to improved water management and policy. Each student will be expected to write (1) two short reflection papers on businesses that visit the class, and (2) a 10- to15-page paper at the conclusion of the class on an idea that the student has for a new water company, on an existing water company of the student's choice, or on a legal or policy initiative that can improve the role that business plays in improving water management (either in a particular sector or more generally).

    "courseDescr": "This 1-unit synchronous course equips students with the tools to design and lead organizations that meaningfully advance health equity. Grounded in clinical experience and managerial decision making, it examines how organizational structures and incentives shape disparities in access, quality, and outcomes, and how they can be deliberately redesigned to better serve patients. Students approach health equity through an organizational lens, learning how values translate into real operational choices and measurable impact across healthcare and related sectors. Through cases, simulations, and practitioner perspectives, the course emphasizes practical judgment, helping students weigh efficiency against equity, recognize unintended consequences, and develop strategies that embed equity into core organizational strategy rather than treating it as an add on. The course is required for MD MBA students in the Health Equity MD/MA scholars program.",

    "courseDescr": "When the Internet took off in China in the 1990s, it was in many ways a US production gone global, one that many believed would drive democratic reforms around the world. By the 2000s, China's government was both pushing technology use for development and developing intricate controls. The 2010s brought the smartphone revolution, where US and Chinese firms played crucial complementary roles as the two countries' governments took contrasting policy paths. In the 2020s, digital and other advanced technologies are both drivers of and battlegrounds in US-China discord. This seminar will examine the cooperative and conflictual elements of US-China relations in technology, the fundamentals of China's cyberspace and high-tech policy landscape, and the overlap of geopolitical lenses with the development and use of technologies. Students will plan and complete a final project of a form to be agreed with the instructor. These may take the form of analysis for potential publication by the Stanford DigiChina Project, traditional academic papers, policy briefs, or other mutually agreed formats. Enrollment is by instructor approval. Prior study of contemporary China, ability to conduct research in Chinese, and a demonstrated interest in the specifics of Chinese technology developments or US-China relations in technological fields are ideal but not required qualifications, depending on space. Students may enroll for 1?3 units. Readings and participation will be required for all, with the scale of final projects commensurate with enrollment.

We will then examine the incorporation and operation of international law in the U.S. legal system. In the second half of the course, we will look at a series of contemporary international law topics and issues, including international dispute resolution, international human rights law, the law governing coercion and the use of armed force, the law of armed conflict, international environmental law, and international criminal law. Throughout, we will consider current issues and problems arising in the international arena, as well as whether and to what extent international law affects the behavior of states.

While it can be informed by experiences and ideas about how governance works, governance design focuses distinctly on processes by which governance is deliberately created, whether from scratch or within an established order. It includes the consideration of questions like By and for whom?, Within what scope and scale?, and How and for what purposes? - which are often at least partially decided by the time rules are written or a constitution gets drafted. In this advanced small seminar, we will read and discuss writings -- both historical and contemporary -- that bear on issues, goals, and methods for the design of governance. We will consider theories and evidence from different disciplines and perspectives, while developing and exploring a framework for understanding how governance can and does come about.

Through cases, homework assignments, and classroom discussion, this course provides an overview of efficient compensation schemes across industries, corporate structures  and functions. We discuss the economic trade-offs (and best practices) behind the compensation schemes used to reward talent across industries, including CEOs, hedge fund managers, venture capitalists, consulting partners, entertainers, and professional athletes. The learning objectives are: (1) to understand the overall structure and individual components of compensation schemes and the incentive role that each component plays, (2) to discuss the pros and cons of alternative performance measurement systems and 3) to help you design an optimal compensation scheme based on the relevant economic environment. This course combines lectures and discussions with industry specialists.",

    "courseTitle": "Financial Statement Analysis",
    "courseDescr": "This course is designed to develop students' ability to interpret and use financial accounting information across various economic decision contexts. The perspective taken is that of an outsider relying on publicly-available financial information for investment, credit, and strategic decision-making purposes. The course relies heavily upon financial statement analysis tools and the economic profit-based valuation framework. Through lectures, in-depth case studies, and real-time exercises, the first half of the course covers traditional financial statement analysis-based tools for critically analyzing and assessing a firm's current financial performance and economic condition, including ratio analysis, accounting quality analysis, and financial distress / bankruptcy prediction models. The second half of the course introduces an accounting-based valuation framework and develops the link between financial statement analysis, firm performance, and firm value. The capstone to the course is the completion of a comprehensive, real-time analysis and valuation of a publicly traded firm (or registered IPO candidate).  The course is structured for students to gain a deeper understanding of the economic pressures behind the valuation creation and valuation process. The course will be useful to those students who anticipate making investment or credit decisions at least partially based on historical and prospective financial statement information, and those who want to have a better understanding of how to use financial information to assess whether and how any organization is creating value through its operations and strategic actions.",

Students without the necessary familiarity with these techniques are welcome to take the course, but should expect to have to fill the gaps on their own (and with the help of their classmates!). Given the target audience above, the course has three main objectives. 1) To introduce and investigate both classic and new economic issues at the frontier of current research in international finance and macroeconomics. The purely pedagogical part of the course aims to make students familiar with the questions, the current state of research, and the empirical tools currently being used. 2) To create a mental framework and intuitive understanding of important and active questions. What makes a question interesting? What makes a paper a good paper? How to develop a reasoned view of new (and perhaps yet un-studied) issues in international finance and macroeconomics? This objective is less direct and less formal, but aims to transition the students into full-time researchers. 3) To kick-start students on independent research. For those interested in applied work the course makes you familiar and tries to connect you with existing data at the frontier of the field, both public and proprietary. For those interested in theoretical work the course staff acts as a sounding board for early research ideas.",

Whether you are a manager, director, CEO, a start-up founder, or even undecided, you will absolutely benefit from this class. Assignments include a Personal Reputation Analysis Project, the PRAP, where you will come with an hypothesis about your reputation, then test it by sending out an anonymous survey to friends and colleagues to gather feedback on what you are doing well, and possibly identify blind spots. Next is the RESD, a Reputation Exploration Slide Doc of a leader, company or current reputation situation (national or international). Using frameworks taught in class, you will analyze a reputation and come up with recommendations for that entity to move forward successfully with their reputation improved, fixed or intact. And finally, a personal reflection paper. We will have dynamic guests each with a reputation framework, case study, or lesson to help you navigate and anticipate reputation pitfalls. This is an interactive class built on conversations, activities, and the examination of current events.

    "courseDescr": "GSBGEN 514 - Creating High Potential Ventures in Developing Economies (2 Units) This course addresses the distinctive challenges and opportunities of launching and growing high-potential new ventures in developing economies. Developing economies are attractive targets for entrepreneurs because many are just starting to move up the growth curve, and they offer low-cost operating environments that can be great development labs for potentially disruptive innovations. They increase in attractiveness when their political institutions stabilize and they become more market-friendly. At the same time, developing economies pose serious challenges. Pioneering entrepreneurs take on significant risks to gain early mover advantages. Specifically, entrepreneurs will not be able to count on the same kind of supportive operating environments that we take for granted in the developed world. They often face cumbersome permit and licensing processes, poorly developed financial and labor markets, problematic import and export procedures, unreliable local supply chains, weak infrastructure, corruption, currency risks, limited investment capital, lack of financial exits and more. This course is designed to help would-be entrepreneurs - both founders and members of entrepreneurial teams - better understand and prepare for these issues as they pursue the opportunities and address the challenges to start, grow, and harvest their ventures in these environments. GSBGEN 514 is a seminar/discussion format in which students will read about and discuss the key challenges described above and potential solutions. Guests will describe their own startup and investing experiences in developing economies and answer questions. A framework based on the World Economic Forum (WEF) report on \"Entrepreneurial Ecosystems Around the Globe and Company Growth Dynamics\" will be used to structure the course. Each student will prepare a short write-up as a final assignment on a case chosen from a selection provided by the instructors.

They will find many of these institutions in a state of crisis involving their missions, roles in society, and financing, as well as academic freedom, diversity of identity and thought, and their governance. During the past century, American universities have evolved from being largely white, male, and Protestant to being more diverse in many ways. However, some policies that have contributed to this progress are being abandoned or distorted. For example, in 2023 the Supreme Court prohibited race-based affirmative action, a major vehicle for achieving racial diversity. And programs that were originally designed to counter discrimination based on individuals' identities have sometimes increased divisions among people with different identities. The university's missions of seeking truth and engaging in critical inquiry have been undermined by both progressive and conservative actors. Affective polarization has dramatically increased, and civil and critical discourse are in decline. Controversies about the war in Gaza and current directives by the Trump administration have only exacerbated these problems. We will examine the nature and causes of these and related problems, and consider possible solutions. We will also look at the financing of universities; their relations with industry; the professionalization of college athletics; and at higher education's 'social contract' with Americans.

In some cases, the problems arise because of weak regulation, while in other cases companies succeed only by interacting constructively with nonmarket players such as politicians, interest groups, activists, regulators, and bureaucrats. These players all work within the public institutions that determine the \"rules of the game\" for market activity. The goal of the course is to build a deeper understanding of, and appreciation for, what goes on beyond the market, and to develop tools and frameworks with which to analyze the situation and build integrated strategies. The course is case-based, drawing on case studies from a variety of countries and institutional environments.",

We will also study the strategy of managing these marketplaces: how should matching work, how marketplace design can solve problems of congestion or market thinness, how to discover prices through auctions, and how to get feedback and design a well-functioning rating system. We will also talk about trust and safety as a key pillar of successful marketplaces. We will also learn how to design non-monetary markets that solve big social problems, such as kidney exchange, food banks, public housing, and school choice. Finally, we will discuss the regulatory challenges of these marketplaces, especially with regard to labor income and platform's monopoly power. Applications include online stores; ride-sharing and transportation; advertising and sponsored search; room-sharing and vacation rentals; creator/passion economy; B2B marketplaces; dating; and labor markets.

    "courseDescr": "How do you get the best new social innovations to reach the hundreds of millions of people who need it the most? And how do ensure that they are developed, deployed and scaled in a way that is relevant, appropriate and sustainable? Innovators tackling the world's most difficult problems often ignore, misunderstand, and under-invest in the critical business challenges involved in crossing 'the middle of the value chain.' This is innovation's valley of death: product and system adaption and evaluation; evidence generation and design validation; business and partnership planning; formal or informal regulatory approval and registration. How do you design, introduce, and optimize the intervention's uptake before it can be taken to scale by markets, governments or other systems? The class is taught be Steve Davis, Senior Advisor at the Gates Foundation, former CEO of PATH, IDRI, and Corbis, and former director of social innovation at McKinsey & Co. We take an interdisciplinary approach to look at the factors that pull innovation forward, push it from behind, and (often to the world's detriment) block its successful implementation and scaling. First grounding the discussion in research on innovation and social change, we then apply business principles, real world experiences and several important case studies in global health to examine the way good ideas get stuck, and how good ideas can turn into innovation that matters. We focus on root causes for failure, success factors, and business practices and tools to enable millions of lives to be impacted by social innovation. The seminar combines lectures, case studies, visiting practitioners and team projects focused on the business case for scaling specific social innovations. The goal is to help the next generation of social innovation leaders think more about some of the mistakes of the past, lessons for the future, and new ways of approaching old problems, all from a practitioner's point of view.",

During those six weeks, the course will meet on Tuesday and Thursday. Exactly which five weeks the course will meet will be announced during the Winter quarter. This will involve scheduling with outside guests, but I will make every effort to schedule those six weeks for the first half of the quarter. Students enrolled in the course must take both quarters. All of the first quarter will be spent in a traditional classroom setting but with untraditional materials. Much of the course material will consist of case studies of business transactions (and no case law). We will use those case studies to analyze the economics underlying a wide range of business transactions and the contractual terms and structures used to respond to underlying economic challenges. During the second quarter, we will explore deals in greater detail by studying five complex transactions in full. For this part of the course, students will be divided into groups and will be assigned one of the five deals. Each group will give a presentation of its deal to the class, and in the following class, a lawyer, banker or other participant in the deal will come to class to present the deal based on his or her experience. We study five new deals each year. Deals we have studied over the years have included movie financings, biotech alliances, venture capital financings, cross-border joint ventures, private equity investments, corporate reorganizations, and more.

    "courseDescr": "Freshwater is our most crucial natural resource, but it is facing mounting pressures from climate change and other factors.  While public agencies traditionally dominated water management, private water companies are playing an increasingly important (and sometime controversial) role. In many cases, private companies are making critical contributions to meeting societal water needs (e.g., by developing new technologies and finding new ways to reduce water use).  In other cases, however, the involvement of private companies has proven controversial (e.g., when private companies have taken over public water supply systems in developing countries such as Bolivia). This course will look at established and emerging businesses in the water sector and the legal, economic, and social issues generated by the private sector's involvement. These businesses include water technology companies (e.g., companies commercializing new desalination or water recycling technologies), venture capitalists, water funds (that directly buy and sell water rights), consulting firms, innovative agricultural companies, and large corporations (that increasingly are adopting corporate stewardship programs).  The course will begin with two weeks of introduction to water and the private water sector.  After that, each class will focus on a different water company. Company executives will attend each class session and discuss their business with the class. In most classes, we will examine (1) the viability and efficacy of the company's business plan, (2) the legal and/or social issues arising from the business' work, and (3) how the business might contribute to improved water management and policy. Each student will be expected to write (1) two short reflection papers on businesses that visit the class, and (2) a 10- to15-page paper at the conclusion of the class on an idea that the student has for a new water company, on an existing water company of the student's choice, or on a legal or policy initiative that can improve the role that business plays in improving water management (either in a particular sector or more generally).

    "courseDescr": "This course provides a general introduction to international law and its role in today's complex and interdependent world. We will begin by considering foundational questions about the nature of international law, such as: the origins of international law in the sovereign equality of states; the global governance challenges arising from the absence of assured mechanisms for the interpretation or enforcement of international law; the sources of international law (including treaties and customary international law); the subjects of international law (including states, international organizations, \"peoples,\" and in some respects individuals); the principles of state responsibility; and the bases upon which states may exercise jurisdiction. We will then examine the incorporation and operation of international law in the U.S. legal system. In the second half of the course, we will look at a series of contemporary international law topics and issues, including international dispute resolution, international human rights law, the law governing coercion and the use of armed force, the law of armed conflict, international environmental law, and international criminal law. Throughout, we will consider current issues and problems arising in the international arena, as well as whether and to what extent international law affects the behavior of states and other international actors. This course provides a general grounding in public international law and a foundation for more advanced or specialized international law courses.

    "courseTitle": "Access to Justice: Law, Policy, and Legal Ethics",
    "courseDescr": "The American civil justice system sits at a crossroads. In three-quarters of the 20 million civil cases filed in state courts each year, at least one side lacks a lawyer. Beneath those cases sit tens of millions more legal problems that never make it to court. Many are significant, even life-altering moments: debt disputes, evictions, domestic violence, a former partner behind on child support, an employer refusing to pay overtime, or an insurer who denies a legitimate claim. Yet most people face these problems without legal assistance, or they \"lump it\" rather than navigate a complex system alone. Such large, systemic gaps in access to legal services limit who can vindicate their rights, magnifying disparities based on income, education, race, gender, and ethnicity. They are unfair and undemocratic. The future of the civil justice system, and the legitimacy of the courts at its center, will turn on how--and how well--judges, court administrators, the legal profession, and an array of policymakers respond to these new realities  This course offers a wide survey of the current state of access to civil justice in the United States. Students will consider the long-run causes and consequences of the justice gap and the major features, constituencies, and stakeholders of the state court systems that are struggling to close it. Students will also tour and assess potential solutions--from procedural simplification, to revived Due Process, to new technologies (e.g., online dispute resolution), to efforts to prime the supply of legal help by amending various Model Rules to expand non-lawyer practice of both the human and software sort. Throughout, students will explore the complex ethical rules that govern lawyers and lawyering and investigate whether and how these rules contribute to, and might instead ameliorate, the access-to-justice crisis. Ultimately, students will emerge with a synoptic understanding of one of the most pressing challenges to the legitimacy of the American legal system, along with new ideas about how to chart a career devoted to access to justice.  Student assessment is based on class participation and four short papers.  This course satisfies the Ethics requirement for graduation.",

    "courseTitle": "Constitutional Law: The Fourteenth Amendment",
    "courseDescr": "The Fourteenth Amendment is the source of many of the rights that have been cherished by many people throughout our nation.  Rights pertaining to sex and reproduction, marriage, parenthood, abortion, birth control, educational opportunity, sex discrimination, race discrimination and many more all are rooted in the 14th Amendment. In recent years, the Supreme Court has reshaped significant aspects of 14th Amendment doctrine, and accorded ever more importance to historical understandings in interpreting and applying the Constitution to contemporary society. Recent decisions have prompted considerable controversy and highlight enduring questions about the relation (or distinction) between law and politics in constitutional interpretation.  This course will examine the development of 14th Amendment doctrine, with special attention paid to equal protection and substantive due process. We will examine many contested constitutional questions, including same sex marriage and gender identity, race-based affirmative action in school admissions, and abortion and birth control, among many other topics. These constitutional controversies, in turn, raise broad questions about the meaning of citizenship, freedom, and equality, the very concerns that prompted the adoption of the 14th Amendment.  Readings will include judicial opinions and some scholarly commentary.  In this polarized time, it is important to note that the professor will not privilege any particular view of how the relevant controversies should be resolved. Indeed, our focus will be more on the processes and principles of constitutional decision-making than the outcomes reached by the Court. Students should be prepared to articulate and engage empathetically with arguments and perspectives that are different from their own.

The project of CRT proceeds from the premise that race and law are mutually constitutive, and its canonical works have explored law as historically central to constructing and maintaining racial hierarchy, alongside hierarchy on the basis of gender, religion, disability status, class and sexual orientation among others. In addition to exploring CRT's origins and the liberal and conservative theoretical frameworks to which it sought to respond, this course will consider internal and external critiques to the project, as well as the recent salience and (mis)representation of CRT in political discourse. Unlike most typical CRT courses, this course will also devote significant attention to CRT's trajectory in international legal scholarship, particularly attempts to grapple with race and racism as global structures mutually constitutive with law and imperialism.

Family Law provides the legal context, the background rules, pertaining to what are unquestionably the most important decisions in our lives-- the choice of a life partner, and whether to become a parent. In probing this body of law, we will also explore big questions about how the government should regulate people with respect to their intimate lives. Our first question: If marriage did not exist as a legal institution, would there be any good reason to create it as one?

The course investigates core tensions in posthumous rights: When do the dead's expressed wishes control legal outcomes, and when must they yield to competing interests or basic principles of human dignity? Who has standing to speak for the deceased, and what limits constrain such representation? How do courts balance respect for the dead against the needs and rights of the living? Special attention will be given to questions of inequality and subordination after death, exploring how legal protections may vary based on social status, wealth, or marginalized identity. The seminar integrates doctrinal analysis with philosophical inquiry, engaging questions about the nature of posthumous harm, dignity, legacy and respect. Students will grapple with whether and why the dead can be wronged, how the law should mediate between competing claims to posthumous authority, and what our treatment of the dead reveals about the values and limits of legal systems.

We will begin with analysis of the doctrinal evolution of the federal constitutional right, and the post-Dobbs shift to protections for abortion under new state constitutional amendments and preexisting state precedent, along with related protections such as the right to interstate travel. We will look at the range of stakeholders critical to litigation to protect abortion access and consider some of the practicalities of the lawsuits in which they are involved, including pregnant individuals, abortion care providers, clinics, emergency rooms, reproductive justice organizations, other public interest organizations, and manufacturers and suppliers of abortion medication.  We will analyze litigation strategy concerns common to social justice movements, weighing long-term goals and short-term needs. The role of the federal and state governments will also be examined.

Our theoretical readings are taken from various fields such as psychoanalysis, disabilities studies, dance criticism, phenomenology, lyric studies, and art theory. In addition to exploring questions of the mind/body, we also engage theories on the face and voice as thresholds between the mind/body. How does language capture or convey the mind/body? How does language fail to represent or portray what we would consider mental and/or physical experiences? How do these texts and our engagement with them blur the distinction of the mind/body or bring to light the strange connections between them?

Asking these questions leads us to questions about ourselves: What about us makes us moral agents? Is it our reason? Or is it essential that we emotionally feel each others' pain? Is selfishness irrational, or just unpleasant? Understanding ourselves can help us think about what kinds of artificial minds we would like to make, and, if we can, how. In this class, we provide the philosophical rigor and technical background necessary to robustly interrogate these and related questions.

Finally, we delve into storytelling and figure drawing, embracing the human element of conveying new products and services. As confidence builds, analysis gives way to individual choice. While we express & explore solutions with traditional analog medium, we often bridge 'the digital divide', expressing final projects in several media choices, introducing  \"sketch rendering\" in AI, and stirring in portfolio & professional advice en route.

In this course, we will use video games to complicate our notions of how borders play a role in our experience of different media, engaging critically the various borders (linguistic, national, genre, platform) we encounter in different texts. We will practice critical reading of video games as a form of analysis, where the experience of playing games contributes to our discussion of borders and comparisons of different media cultures. Both China and Japan occupy central positions in discourse surrounding technology and media, but rarely do the conversations align in tone or subject matter. Examining texts from China and Japan, we investigate and challenge divisions between the two countries in contemporary literature and video games.

Despite the many differences, in important ways they face similar challenges in regard to sustainability in the face of climate change, environmental degradation, energy transition, food and water security, poverty, inequality, and the management of conflicts internal and external to their region. Each individual Southeast Asian nation deals with such challenges in ways relevant to their political, economic, environmental, and societal circumstances. At the same time, they have also joined together in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to serve common regional interests and develop long term economic and environmental strategies to promote the security and prosperity of the approximately 670 million citizens of the ASEAN Member States. This course will focus on how Southeast Asian nations manage the tensions between economic development and sustainability, how the policies and strategies they develop impact the societies they are mandated to serve, and the role of good governance, sounds regulatory frameworks, and the rule of law in shaping the outcomes of local, national, and regional initiatives. We will be able to discuss such issues with guest speakers from the region who will participate in several class sessions.",

Is a well-designed constitution sufficient to sustain democratic self-government over time? These questions are as urgent today as they were in antiquity. At a moment when democratic institutions face mounting pressure, this course examines the long history of constitutional thought and practice in order to better understand the promises and limits of constitutional democracy. The course traces the development of constitutionalism from Ancient Greece and Rome through medieval, early modern, and modern political thought, culminating in contemporary debates over executive power, judicial review, populism, and democratic self-defense. Students will study classical accounts of democracy and its failures; theories of sovereignty, representation, and the separation of powers; and the constitutional experiments. By placing canonical texts in dialogue with historical case studies, students will gain a deeper understanding of constitutional design, democratic stability, and the enduring tension between popular rule and the rule of law.",

Through manifestos, memoirs, films, podcasts, and scholarly texts, we examine anti-colonial insurgencies, leftist movements, feminist organizations, postcolonial state-building, and contemporary activism. By placing the Middle East within the broader history of the Global South, the course presents political history as a story of social struggles that crossed geographic and cultural boundaries.

This followed U.S. threats to annex Greenland and punish resistant NATO allies, along with false claims that NATO had failed to assist the United States in past crises. That same week, the United States extrajudicially seized Venezuela's leader, declared de facto governance over the country, and sidelined its democratic opposition to install the former regime's vice president as head of state. Meanwhile, the world economy is experiencing a return to tariff levels not seen since the 1930s, as many states increasingly view economic interdependence as strategic liability rather than mutual benefit. Humanitarian regimes governing refugee treatment, food provision in conflict, and civilian protection are eroding, with countries abandoning longstanding obligations. The United States has shunned international organizations and military alliances it once championed. Historic allies like Canada face tariffs, annexation threats, and public insults from the American president. These examples represent only a partial catalogue of upheaval. How do we make sense of this moment? And can our existing frameworks for understanding international relations help us - or are they part of the problem? This course brings together international relations scholars and practitioners in weekly conversations to examine how they interpret contemporary crises and, crucially, whether their training prepared them for this moment or failed to. We will interrogate both today's disruptions and the analytical paradigms we use to understand them.

Shortly after the discussion, Huygens, a Dutch scientist, published De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae (The Value of all Chances in Games of Fortune) in 1657; this is considered to be the first treatise on probability. Due to the inherent appeal of games of chance, probability theory soon became popular, and the subject underwent rapid development in the 18th century with contributions from mathematical giants, such as Bernoulli, de Moivre, and Laplace. There are two fairly different lines of thought associated with applications of probability: the solution of betting/gambling and the analysis of statistical data related to quantitative subjects such as mortality tables and insurance rates. In this Introsem, we will discuss poker and other games of chance, such as daily fantasy sports, from the perspective of risk analysis. This Introsem does not require any programming knowledge, but some experience with Excel, MATLAB, R, and/or Python will enhance your experience in our discussion of daily fantasy sports.

But we also experience Others in a more direct way.  When we have a conversation with a sibling, or see a stranger on the street, we experience them as having a mind - a nest of thoughts, feelings, emotions. Even if we are not sure exactly what they are experiencing, we are assured that they are experiencing something. And yet, in philosophy, the classic problem of other minds won't go away. I believe that I have a mind; but the data and methods I use to arrive at this belief are not available to me when it comes to others. I form my concept of mind out of my own experience, and I apply that concept to myself using criteria that also are based in my own experience; but these criteria cannot be met, and thus not applied, to others. In this seminar, we will explore the problem of other minds, and its possible solutions and dissolutions, by reading selected works from both the analytic and continental traditions, including (possibly) writings by Descartes, Locke, Reid, Husserl, Stein, Scheler, Sartre, Fanon, Levinas, Austin, Ayer, Wittgenstein, Kripke, Cavell, Nagel, Godfrey-Smith, Avramides, Gallgher and Zahavi.",

    "courseDescr": "This policy lab is a two-quarter course that examines how law and policy should evolve to govern the rise of autonomous systems in outer space - from AI-assisted satellite operations to self-directed on-orbit servicing and collision-avoidance technologies. The lab's policy client is The Aerospace Corporation, a non-profit organization that advises the U.S. government on space enterprise and systems engineering issues. The lab situates the rise of AI-driven autonomy and related technological developments within the emerging \"New Space\" era. Private companies such as SpaceX, Planet, and Astroscale are transforming the once state-dominated domain of space into a crowded and commercially driven ecosystem. As of 2024, about 10,000 satellites orbit the Earth, a number projected by the European Space Agency to grow nearly tenfold by 2030. Once in orbit, these satellites must navigate a spinning web of over 140 million pieces of space debris, all of which are moving at velocities several times faster than a bullet. This rapid expansion has amplified concerns about the risk of a cascading collision chain - known as the Kessler Syndrome - that could render key orbital regions unusable for generations. In this context, spacecraft are becoming increasingly automated, leveraging AI in navigation, collision avoidance, and mission management. Yet, this also raises urgent questions about how to regulate accountability, transparency, and safety in an increasingly autonomous orbital environment. The lab will run for two quarters. Students will analyze how responsibility is assigned when AI acts autonomously in space, how autonomous systems can be verified as safe and auditable, and how post-incident investigation and enforcement should function. Throughout the lab, students will engage directly with a range of stakeholders, including industry, government, and research institutions, to assess current issues, test ideas, and refine policy analysis. The lab team will synthesize their findings into a comprehensive policy report outlining options and suggestions for governing AI in space. The course will be cross-listed with Law 810G and students selected based on the consent of the instructor. Only students who participated in the prior quarter's project will qualify to be admitted to the Spring quarter practicum.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, performance, class participation, written assignments, final paper. CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available at SLS Registrar https://registrar.law.stanford.edu/. Students should log-in upper right on the SLS landing page and then choose \"Policy Practicum\" to apply.  If you are an admitted student wishing to enroll in the AA 262 course, you should forward the permission email you received for LAW 810G directly to Jenny Scholes (jscholes@stanford.edu) in the Aeronautics & Astronautics (AA) department.

    "courseTitle": "The Future of Food: Defining Challenges to Reinvent Food Systems",
    "courseDescr": "One of the greatest challenges facing modern humanity is how to provide nutritious food to a growing population without contributing to human disease and destroying the environment. Many of the leading causes of death in the US directly relate to our dietary habits, costing billions in health care costs annually, while globally it is estimated that 1 in 3 people suffer from nutrition deficiencies. In parallel, approximately 1/3 of the world's energy production and 2/3 of fresh water is diverted to food production and current industrial food systems contribute to a quarter of carbon emissions. Given the complexity and scale of this collective challenge it can be difficult to predict and quantify how a proposed solution or technology might contribute to a shift in our food systems towards a more sustainable future for both human and planetary health. In this course we will examine in depth a single facet of our current food system (based on class interest - e.g. water systems, crop biotechnology, pesticide use, food waste). We will do a historical analysis of this technology and/or current practices and identify opportunities for innovation by defining the scope of the current problem. Inspired by the World Health Organization \"Target Product Profile\" model that guides the development of new vaccines and disease diagnostics, the outcome of our work will be a solution-agnostic problem  statement that identifies specific needs, stakeholders, and solution criteria for a specific food system challenge. We will integrate feedback from topical experts, relevant stakeholders, and community members. Ultimately, our work will culminate in a white paper defining a critical unmet need in our current food system that will inspire innovative solutions towards a sustainable food future. Graduate or upper level undergraduate students who have a background in engineering or science and prior research experience are invited to join. We especially encourage participation from students interested in critical objective analysis of grand challenges and how to identify specific, actionable problems that will inspire durable change. This is the inaugural instance of this course, but we anticipate the \"Food-TPP\" process we will develop together will result in a repository of actionable problem statements and serve as an invaluable framework for addressing any sustainability challenge of interest.",

    "courseTitle": "Critical Humanism in the Life and Works of Edward Said: Philology, Power, and Palestine",
    "courseDescr": "This course will explore a range of genres and styles from the corpus of, Edward Said (1935-2003) - the Palestinian American literary scholar and critic whose work continues to inform and influence numerous fields in the humanities and social sciences, and which maintains popularity among general audiences outside the university, as well. Across works of critical theory, literary analysis, memoir, occasional writing, political commentary, and other traditions, Said's critical oeuvre both exposes the ways in which humanistic inquiry has historically served systems of domination--like colonialism and slavery - while it offers theoretical and practical strategies for advancing a critical recuperation of humanism. We will explore Said's injunction for a 'return to philology' as the field of activity whose tools and methods illuminate the historical affiliations of knowledge with power. We will begin by studying Said's early elaborations of 'intention and method' in Beginnings (1975), where he develops tools for tracing the processes by which texts acquire meaning and form. From there, we will follow the evolution and augmentation of key concepts in his critical lexicon - such as \"contrapuntal reading,\" \"worldliness,\" \"secular interpretation,\" \"imaginative geography,\" \"traveling theory\" and \"lateness.\" How might such modes of close reading transcend the realm of textual exegesis, and help us to uncover language's constitutive role in shaping configurations of political ontology, and the secular formations of social and cultural authority? In addition to major works of theory and criticism like Orientalism (1978), The World, the Text, and the Critic (1983), and Culture and Imperialism (1993), we will consider the throughlines of Said's ideas and methods as they extend across and between literary, musical, cultural, historical, and political concerns, including the question of Palestine. We will situate Said's works in the historical contexts of their authorship, production, and receptions - reading his texts through the purview of their interpolations among contemporaneous debates and trends in literary studies and critical theory - such as (post)structuralism, New Criticism, Marxism, New Historicism, the 'spatial turn,' postcolonialism, world literature, and Area Studies. Notwithstanding the anti-systematic quality that characterized Said's deferral to \"secular criticism\" as a refusal of critical orthodoxy, we will attempt to discern the structural limits of this worldly orientation. What methodological insights or critical strategies from Said's life and work can we adapt for our contemporary moment - amid global crises in the humanities, technological transformation, and ongoing colonial violence in Palestine and beyond?",

This course introduces key themes and debates in the history and historiography of modern Eastern Europe. Stretching from the Baltic to the Balkans and across the former Habsburg, Ottoman, and Russian lands, the region has been marked by shifting borders, overlapping empires, and competing national projects. Yet it has also been a contested concept, shaped as much by outside observers as by those who lived within it. Covering the period from the late eighteenth century to the end of the twentieth, the course examines empires and their legacies, national revivals and indifference, the collapse of multiethnic states in 1918, fascism and communism, collaboration and violence, borderlands and migration, and the politics of memory after 1989. Readings pair classic works that established the field with recent scholarship that has reshaped it, complemented by selected art, literature, and film. The colloquium emphasizes not only what we know about Eastern Europe, but how and why its history has been written the way it has.",

This course is designed to provide graduate students with an intensive introduction to twentieth-century U.S. social, political, transnational, and cultural history and historiography. We will read classic and canonical works as well as recent literature that has pushed the boundaries of the field. We will investigate a series of interrelated issues that have been central to twentieth-century historiography: nation-building; the changing organization of work and leisure; the rise of mass culture and mass consumption; changing and contested notions of American identity in the context of mass immigration and racial and gender conflict; and social movements and the politics of everyday life. We will pay close attention to the multiple meanings and significance of racial, ethnic, class, gender, sexual, religious, and nationalist identifications. History courses develop students' knowledge of how past events influence today's society,and help students to understand how humans view themselves. There are four main goals for this class:  1) students will acquire a perspective on history and an understanding of the factors that shape human life; 2) students will display knowledge about the origins and nature of contemporary issues and develop a foundation for comparative understanding; 3) students will think, speak, and write critically about primary and secondary historical sources by examining diverse interpretations of past events and ideas in their historical contexts; and 4) students will gain expertise in discussing historiography and will gain critical knowledge for teaching history courses and successfully passing oral examinations.",

(2) Plato is a Rational Eudaimonist (roughly, the ultimate end of all rational action is the agent's own greatest happiness). Is Rational Eudaimonism unacceptably egoistic and insufficiently impartial? (3) Why does Plato move from accepting Psychological Eudaimonism (roughly, whenever a person acts, she tries to perform the action that she believes optimally conduces to her greatest happiness) to rejecting it and accepting weakness of will (akrasia)? What are the implications for views about the unity of the person and mental transparency? (4) What's the place of pleasure in happiness and ethical learning? This question leads to some basic issues in Plato's ethical psychology, ethical epistemology, and metaphysics of value. (5) What's the relation between ethical knowledge and ethical belief? This question leads to basic issues in Plato's epistemology and metaphysics. (6) What conceptions of goodness does Plato have (attributive, relational, and non-relational) and what are the relations among them? (7) In Plato's axiology, does he accept an organic unity account of goods (as did G. E.

    "courseDescr": "This policy lab is a two-quarter course that examines how law and policy should evolve to govern the rise of autonomous systems in outer space--from AI-assisted satellite operations to self-directed on-orbit servicing and collision-avoidance technologies. The lab's policy client is The Aerospace Corporation, a non-profit organization that advises the U.S. government on space enterprise and systems engineering issues. The lab situates the rise of AI-driven autonomy and related technological developments within the emerging \"New Space\" era. Private companies such as SpaceX, Planet, and Astroscale are transforming the once state-dominated domain of space into a crowded and commercially driven ecosystem. As of 2024, about 10,000 satellites orbit the Earth, a number projected by the European Space Agency to grow nearly tenfold by 2030. Once in orbit, these satellites must navigate a spinning web of over 140 million pieces of space debris, all of which are moving at velocities several times faster than a bullet. This rapid expansion has amplified concerns about the risk of a cascading collision chain--known as the Kessler Syndrome--that could render key orbital regions unusable for generations. In this context, spacecraft are becoming increasingly automated, leveraging AI in navigation, collision avoidance, and mission management. Yet, this also raises urgent questions about how to regulate accountability, transparency, and safety in an increasingly autonomous orbital environment. The lab will run for two quarters. Students will analyze how responsibility is assigned when AI acts autonomously in space, how autonomous systems can be verified as safe and auditable, and how post-incident investigation and enforcement should function. Throughout the lab, students will engage directly with a range of stakeholders, including industry, government, and research institutions, to assess current issues, test ideas, and refine policy analysis. The lab team will synthesize their findings into a comprehensive policy report outlining options and suggestions for governing AI in space. The course will be cross-listed and students selected based on the consent of the instructor. Cross-listed with International Policy and School of Engineering. Elements used in grading: Attendance, performance, class participation, written assignments, final paper. If you are an admitted student wishing to enroll in the AA 262 course, you should forward the permission email you received for LAW 810G directly to Jenny Scholes in the Aeronautics & Astronautics (AA) department.

    "courseTitle": "Policy Practicum: Fair Compensation of Prison Labor in the U.S.",
    "courseDescr": "More than 1.2 million people are incarcerated in state and federal prisons in the United States. Many of them work in the facilities in which they are housed, as laborers for the prison itself (laundry, kitchen, custodial) or for government agencies or private companies that use prisoners as workers. Financial compensation for prison labor varies across the United States but tends to be meager. How should prisoners be compensated for the work they do while they are incarcerating? While the purposes of imprisonment will always be subject to conflicting views, this policy lab rests on the premise that rehabilitation is or should be at least one of the goals of incarceration; that prison work should be part of the process of rehabilitation, not part of the punishment imposed on an incarcerated person; and that any model of compensation for prison labor must respect principles of fairness and individual dignity while meeting the pragmatic test of sustainability. Using these principles, this policy lab will develop a framework for setting fair and appropriate levels of compensation for prison labor, taking into account monetary wages and also various forms of non-wage compensation, such as earned time credits, education and vocational training. Students will research legal and policy issues that will inform the framework, including valuing the range of benefits prisoners receive and deserve. Learning from other contexts where fair compensation models have been developed in the context of similar characteristics, students will develop proposals that could be adopted by U.S. jurisdictions. Towards the end of the course, students will have an opportunity to present their conclusions to a panel of experts and stakeholders whose feedback will inform the final product. The final deliverable will be a report that outlines the model and the rationales behind it. This course will be taught simultaneously to a course being offered at the University of Gottingen in Germany where law students will be working to respond to a German Federal Constitutional Court order from June 2023 ordering two states in Germany to develop a model of fair compensation of prisoner labor (see: https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2023/bvg23-056.html). There will be opportunities for Stanford students to learn with and from their German counterparts. Elements used in grading: Attendance, performance, class participation, written assignments, final paper.

We will seek to understand how the separation of ownership and control produces agency costs, and the ways in which corporate law seeks to remedy these costs through techniques like disclosure, fiduciary duties, shareholder litigation, voting, and hostile takeovers. We will read and discuss ongoing debates among scholars and practitioners about the agency cost framework, the merits and limits of current legal policies, and the role of institutional arrangements like activist shareholders. We will also consider the relevance of these disputes, and the effectiveness of corporate law and governance more generally, in the context of a variety of real-life incidents.

    "courseDescr": "Climate displacement is a critical and growing challenge, with wide-ranging social, economic, cultural, and psychological impacts. This seminar explores how climate change is reshaping human mobility, from cross-border migration to planned relocation and adaptive strategies in place. We examine the drivers of climate-induced displacement, migration pathways, the experiences of Indigenous peoples and other vulnerable populations, and the legal, policy, and governance frameworks that shape responses. The course also considers the role of institutions, finance, and media in framing and addressing climate mobility, and emphasizes equity, resilience, and justice in potential solutions. Through student-led discussions, guest lectures, and research-based assignments, students will engage with the structural forces influencing climate migration and develop tools to analyze and propose informed, actionable interventions. Each three-hour class is designed to balance learning, discussion, and real-world insight. We'll start with a short lecture that introduces the week's topic and connects it to the readings, followed by an open group discussion. Some weeks, we'll work in groups through a case study to see how these ideas play out in practice. In the final hour, a virtual guest expert will join us to share their research or field experience and on the week's topic.",

But as renowned psychologist Erich Fromm said as far back as the 1950's, love appears to be disintegrating in modern society. This may be partly because most of us don't in fact understand it very well. It may be true that, as the Beatles say, All You Need is Love, but it also seems, as Lady Gaga says, we Don't Know What Love Is. This class is designed to give students an opportunity to take a deep dive into the nature of love - its history, its practice, and how it has been studied - and develop your skills for communicating what you've learned through presentations to your peers. We will look at all types of love, from familial and brotherly to romantic and spiritual, and you will be introduced to conflicting ways it has been defined (a drive, an emotion, an orientation to the world, etc.), functions it has been given (reproduction, kinship, finding ultimate truth, etc.), and ways people have cultivated it (service, therapy, spiritual practice). The course will introduce you to how various disciplines such as anthropology, biology, psychology, and art approach a complex experience such as love. And it will introduce you to different ways we can talk about big topics like love, especially through short presentations about our own learning.  You will write a short research paper, a short story, and at the end of the quarter you will make a formal oral presentation about what your research and writing has taught you.

The latter thinker, in bringing Platonic warnings about writing in dialogue with more contemporary technologies, is far from alone in the concern he articulates over the increased capacity to know (in his terms, \"savoir\") at the expense of capacities to know \"how to do\" and \"how to live\" (roughly, savoir-faire and savoir-vivre). The early modern readings of this course aim to open up these questions of savoir-faire in particular, considering practices that may include essay writing (Bacon, Locke, Haywood), the humanist exercises of progymnasmata (Aesop's Fables), lyric poetry (Wyatt, Herbert, Marvell), learned textual commentary and political counsel (Shakespeare, Sidney), devotional world-building (Milton, Bunyan, Hutchinson), life-writing and the novel (Defoe, Richardson, Sterne). Depending on participant interest, assigned readings may include twenty-first century studies that produce lenses at once retrospective and future-oriented to ask - what, after all, are the defining methods, techniques, or practices of our discipline?",

Students will learn from the instructors, course peers, and class visitors, particularly top current search entrepreneurs, CEOs, and investors. This course is designed to assist students who are seriously pursuing a search fund. Those who have taken Entrepreneurial Acquisition (S543) or researched search funds extensively, including holding discussions with current searchers, investors, and CEO's, will benefit the most from this advanced, experiential course. By the end of the course, students will be prepared to or will already have raised search capital and launched their search, if they choose to do so. The course is not a good fit for students who do not know the basics of search funds (such as from taking S543) or are not likely to pursue a search fund upon or within a few years of graduation. Pursuing self-developed work plans that target the aspects of the search fund path most relevant to them at the time of the course, students will target industry segments and business models, evaluate investors, structure their search entity, set up their search process and outreach materials, perhaps begin to contact business owners, and develop wisdom about what makes a deal attractive or unattractive, among other experiences. Students will hear from class guests, including current searchers, standing CEO's of search-acquired companies, active investors, and former searchers (some of whom \"failed\" at buying a company) in order to inform their various decisions as they pursue a search fund. Each student will receive feedback on how they can be a more effective search fund entrepreneur. Teams of two are fine but not necessary. Most students join the class as individuals and all will be graded individually.This course is offered by the Graduate School of Business. It builds on the processes taught in Entrepreneurial Acquisition (S543) and detailed in the Stanford Primer on Search Funds (2020). The course provides a supportive yet challenging environment that will help students step outside of their comfort zone and accelerate learning.

Yet, this requirement is not uniform across legal domains, only applies to some people, and has changed over time. This seminar will explore the concept of the \"unreasonable person,\" those who do not fulfill the threshold of legal accountability, and its implications. We will discuss the developments of doctrines, such as insanity, incapacity, minority, and senility, that attempt to define those who fall short of full legal accountability. We will also examine how the law has grappled with the activities of \"unreasonable people.\"  We will also consider legal fictions, such as the reasonable person standard, which attempts to clarify those who qualify for full legal accountability and how they have shifted historically. This class will appeal to those interested in disability law, elder law, children and the law, and those who desire a cross-doctrinal conversation incorporating criminal law, torts, and constitutional law.

Arbitration's promise of neutral, enforceable, and efficient dispute resolution has allowed it to flourish, despite criticisms of high cost, systemic bias, and lack of transparency. The course will equip students with the theoretical foundations and key practical skills for engaging in the practice of international commercial arbitration. Core areas of study will include the drafting of arbitration agreements; the appointment of arbitrators; the conduct of arbitral proceedings; and the enforcement of arbitral awards. Attention will be given to instances where common law and civil law traditions intersect, particularly in the use and production of evidence.

    "courseDescr": "The mass movement of people across international borders is widely framed as among the most pressing challenges of the 21st Century. Globally, debates regarding immigration law and policy remain controversial political flashpoints. The purpose of this seminar is a critical examination of the international legal theory, doctrine, and practice of borders and migration, which are essential for making sense of national immigration regimes, and the contentious debates around them.  An emerging body of critical scholarship is challenging the fundamental assumptions that underlie the law and political theory of borders and international migration, and that does so by foregrounding the ways in which colonial, neocolonial and other forms of empire have shaped contemporary borders. This seminar will introduce students to this emerging body of scholarship and to the applicable international law. We will consider borders as sites of racial, political, and other forms of injustice. We will also consider some of the legal arguments that have been made for decolonial, reparatory, abolitionist, and other approaches to reimagining borders.  The seminar will introduce students to Third World Approaches to International Law--an approach to the study of international law that centers the mutually-constitutive relationship between European colonialism and foundational international legal doctrine. TWAIL examines international law as a (contested) historical and contemporary system of Third World subordination, and explores the possibilities of more just international legal futures. The seminar will also include Critical Race Theory analysis of borders and international migration.  Public international law is not a prerequisite course for this seminar. However, students who have not taken public international law will be encouraged to do some additional assigned background reading in order fully engage with the seminar's central themes. The course will be evaluated based on attendance, class participation, reading responses and a presentation.

    "courseTitle": "Ideological Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy",
    "courseDescr": "Most significant substantive legal disputes you all confront in law school are \"resolved\" at least as much by reference to ideological predispositions as any sort of logic internal to legal analysis. We will begin the seminar by discussing some competing views about what key ideological messages are conveyed at law school. But the bulk of the course is devoted to a series of questions that arise for those of us who believe that ideology is important. We examine in modest detail what I would characterize as Right-wing orthodoxy in the law schools, an orthodoxy that took shape in the early days of the Federalist Society. Its key procedural features were allegiance to originalism and textualism and a preference for rules over standards, its key substantive features full-throated or \"soft\" economic libertarianism and hostility to legal rules that attended to status and identity. It seems implausible from my vantage, though, that this orthodox position can remain so dominant: the entire political Right of the legal academy cannot possibly cling to unadulterated or even slightly modified Reaganite Classical small-l liberalism (domestically) and neoconservatism (internationally) when Reaganism has been largely obliterated as a political force in the Republican Party. That is true even though one must recognize that much of the \"policy substance\" driving whatever conventional policy agenda MAGA -- or at least much of the Project 2025 branch thereof -- brings to the table is familiar Reaganite resistance to redistribution and regulation. Thus, we will focus more carefully on Right-wing heterodoxy: resistance to these conventional positions from commentators who reject in significant part the Classical small-liberal Reaganite tenets, typically in favor of a more activist, illiberal, significantly theocratic state; the ethno-nationalism associated with the MAGA movement; and/or increased sympathy or support for facilitating or even endorsing what many would label authoritarian rule. We also carefully study 21st century progressive orthodoxy (with its strong focus on countering identity-based subordination) and progressive heterodoxy.  We will study heterodoxy and orthodoxy in a number of contexts. We will look, for instance, both at how illiberal academics on the Right have rejected \"old FedSoc\" race-blindness and, even more carefully, at how and why a number of heterodox political progressives have shunned familiar progressive claims about the centrality of diversity, implicit bias, and the importance of countering individual acts of discrimination; questioned significant claims for disability accommodation and \"universal design;\" worried about aspects of the regime regulating sexual harassment; and shown less hostility to accommodation of religious objectors to antidiscrimination law. We will examine with some care how those on the Left and the Right have shifted their views about how (and why) power should be allocated between legislatures, agencies (especially historically independent ones), and the President attending with special care to the question of whether certain forms of \"presidentialism\" facilitate authoritarianism.  You will each be expected to prepare two reaction papers (of roughly five to eight pages) over the course of the term, responding to some or all of the readings you have read for a session.  60% of your grade will be based on these papers. You will also be expected to prepare (on four occasions) three or four questions or comments on the session's readings (these can be as short as a few lines or as long as a page). These must be turned in at the very latest by noon before class: I hope I will be able to make some use of these questions and comments in figuring out what aspects of the reading might be most profitable to emphasize during the afternoon's class. 20% of your grade will be based on these four \"mini-papers.\" Finally, 20% of your grade will be based on attendance and participation.",

Much of the focus will be on lawyers who work for public interest organizations or a government, but some of the discussion will consider issues in private practice as well. Materials will include case law, rules of professional responsibility, and less traditional sources. The aim of this course is not to prepare you to pass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination, because becoming an ethical practitioner is not a matter of acing a multiple choice test.

Hands-on projects are conducted on a dobby loom, a computer-controlled TC2 loom, and a traditional etching press using digital design and/or coding processes in an iterative workflow. After a series of introductory demos and exercises, students will pursue individual or small team projects based on their own conceptual interests. We will cycle our designs between the looms, the press, and various digital software to hone our understanding of the affordances and difficulties of each modality, and to discover new possibilities for creativity at these intersections. Why weaving and print making? Both looms and printing presses are technologies of reproduction; each allows a pre-designed visual pattern or image to be generated repeatedly. Jacquard looms and movable type are key moments in the lineages of encoding that lead to our contemporary digital tools. We will explore concepts of encoding information: what is included, excluded, and how that information is expressed, as themes throughout this course. Another theme we will explore is the physical labor and skill required by these practices: for weaving -  threading a loom, lifting heddles up and down, and throwing a shuttle back and forth across a loom; or for printmaking -  grinding, etching, inking and wiping a metal plate and cranking it through a printing press. What does engaging with these tactile embodied practices of weaving and printmaking add to our experience as artists and craftspeople, and to our finished products? How can a deep understanding of physical processes and materials be used in dialog with contemporary digital workflows? What happens when we tangle the digital with these embodied processes? This course does not have specific pre-requisites, but is an upper level course appropriate for students with prior experience in either weaving, printmaking or digital design processes.

    "courseTitle": "Literature and the Practice of Freedom",
    "courseDescr": "This seminar investigates literature as a practice of freedom, taking as its theoretical foundation Richard Rorty's revolutionary claim that human liberation comes not through discovering truth but through redescription. For Rorty, literature's unique power lies in its capacity to provide new vocabularies, metaphors, and narratives that allow us to reimagine ourselves and our possibilities. By showing us that our deepest assumptions about identity, society, and meaning are contingent rather than necessary, literature opens spaces for transformation - both personal and collective. Through intensive engagement with contemporary writers - J.M. Coetzee, W.G. Sebald, Annie Ernaux, Rachel Cusk, and Miranda July - we will explore how literary redescription works in practice. These writers demonstrate how reimagining the languages we use to narrate experience can fundamentally alter what that experience can become. Their innovations in form and voice reveal writing as a tool for escaping what Rorty calls our \"final vocabularies,\" those inherited descriptions that ordinarily constrain our sense of the possible. We will examine how their work challenges conventional boundaries between fiction and philosophy, self and other, private and public, creating new modes of attention and understanding. The course situates Rorty's pragmatist vision of literature within a broader philosophical conversation about freedom, drawing on Nietzsche's perspectivism, Heidegger's poetics of dwelling, and Arendt's conception of narrative identity. Together, these thinkers help us understand how literary redescription operates as ethical and political practice: not by prescribing how we should live, but by expanding our imaginative resources for conceiving how we might live. Through close reading and creative response, students will engage with literature as a liberating force - one that doesn't reveal hidden truths but creates new possibilities for human flourishing.",

How might renewed attention to the \"spectrality\" of contemporary Asia's national and interstitial states reorient and destabilize our notions of time, being, and place? Focusing on recent anthropological and ethnographic accounts of the spectral and ethereal in Asia to understand the politics at the margins, this course takes seriously the spectral images, imaginations, and phantoms of inequity, division, and historical legacy, or as Byron Good recently put it, \"the anthropology of being haunted\" as a means of grappling with the future of Asia as an entity and identity.",

Climates of Inequality have worked with Universities and communities in over 20 cities across the US and around the world.  Local teams work together to activate the histories of 'frontline' communities: those who have contributed the least to the climate crisis but bear its heaviest burdens. The multimedia portraits expose the roots of current environmental injustice, and share generations of frontline communities' strategies for resistance, resilience, and mitigation. The project promotes a future vision for confronting the climate crisis that understands, and resists environmental harms. By compiling these histories in an evolving internationally traveling exhibit with local events at every stop, this project seeks to affirm frontline communities' work and inspire others to action for climate and environmental justice.  Students will collaborate with our community partners to collect oral histories and create a podcast project that will accompany the exhibition. Students will also engage with literature to understand the rise in economic inequality in Silicon Valley and the relationship between economic inequality and environmental injustice.

If so, how should critics and readers label these non-mimetic texts in decolonial Francophone contexts? Are they new examples of surrealism, magical realism, Afrofuturism, African futurism, science fiction, fantasy, or speculative fiction? What are the stakes in assigning these labels, and how does the interpretation of these works impact their reception, translation, and proliferation in a global marketplace? Discussions will focus on topics such as (de/post/neo) colonialism, globalization, modernity, migration, multilingualism, racialization, authorship and relation in our analysis of the aesthetics and politics of unnatural narrative across the French-speaking world.

In essence, the material serves as a practical guide to managing workplace behavior - your own and that of others. To explain key concepts, we draw on robust social science research that highlights several challenging aspects of leadership: making sound decisions, motivating employees, influencing others to support your ideas, and dealing with difficult personalities. We explore these challenges using readings, cases, lectures, experiential exercises, and discussion of examples from actual organizations. Given that the course is only one quarter long and the potential scope of concepts, theories, and applications is immense, we are forced to be highly selective. We will spend only a single session on topics that could easily take an entire quarter. The objective is to expose you to the most critical ideas and outline a framework to guide your future learning - not offering specific recipes for leading others, but enabling you to solve novel leadership challenges independently and with confidence.",

Group functionality and outcomes can be significantly improved by any group member who has the awareness and skills of a facilitator, whether or not that person is formally designated as the facilitator. The interactive class methodology will combine discussion with many exercises and roleplays, putting facilitation tools into practice every step of the way. We will examine group dynamics and learn skills used by professional facilitators to prevent common problems and elicit the best work of a group. We will explore how to prepare effectively with clear goals, collaborative problem definition, inclusive process design and a well-structured agenda. We will also discuss and practice core meeting management skills such as how to balance voice and participation, build consensus, inspire creativity and promote principled evaluation and decision-making.

    "courseDescr": "Medicine and Horsemanship is a unique outdoor experience working with horses to develop interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, and self-care techniques. A challenge throughout a clinical career is to conduct relationships with patients and colleagues in a manner that is professional, perceptive, confident, and authentic. Horses mirror and magnify our intentions and behaviors. Working with horses requires sensitivity to nonverbal cues, discrimination in the quality and amount of physical contact, and an awareness of one's emotional state, all important skills for relating to patients. Horses give non-judgmental feedback about our personal communication styles and our ability to operate from a place of empathy and kindness. The course also teaches how to recognize subjectivity in judgment and how to overcome fear and immobility in the face of uncertainty. No riding is required and no previous horse experience is needed. Limit 14 students.",
